# Browser Bible 

A browser based Bible Study Application built with the holy trinity of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

* Created by: [Digital Bible Society](http://www.dbsbible.org)
* Project Leader: John Dyer http://j.hn/
* Code License: GPLv2/MIT
* Content License: See each content folder for a license

## Goals

HTML and JavaScript based Bible software that can run

* on any browser
* on any device
* in any nation

The application has full search and highlighting features but requires

* no install
* no server
* no trace

To make this happen, there are two ways to view the same biblical content

* *Mobile Version* - The mobile version uses [jQuery Mobile](http://www.jquerymobile.com/) to navigate through the Bible chapter by chapter
* *Desktop Version* - The desktop version is a multipane application based off ideas at http://biblewebapp.com/

## Credits

Many of the texts are the product of the hard work of many individuals dedicated to open
source work including [Open Scriptures](http://openscriptures.org) and [CrossWire](http://www.crosswire.org/). Thanks for the great work!

* *WLC* - [MorphHB](https://github.com/openscriptures/morphhb) project from Open Scriptures and David Troidl
* *Strongs* - [strong database](https://github.com/openscriptures/strongs) in JSON format

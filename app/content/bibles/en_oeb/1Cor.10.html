<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.10.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>I want you to bear in mind, Brothers, that all our ancestors were beneath the cloud, and all passed through the sea;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.10.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>that in the cloud and in the sea they all underwent baptism as followers of Moses;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.10.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>and that they all ate the same supernatural food,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.10.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>and all drank the same supernatural water, for they used to drink from a supernatural rock which followed them, and that rock was the Christ.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.10.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>Yet with most of them God was displeased; for they were &lsquo;struck down in the desert.&rsquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.10.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>Now these things happened as warnings to us, to teach us not to long for evil things as our forefathers longed.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.10.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>Do not become idolaters, as some of them became. Scripture says-&rsquo;The people sat down to eat and drink, and stood up to dance.&rsquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.10.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>Nor let us act immorally, as some of them acted, with the result that twenty-three thousand of them fell dead in a single day.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.10.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>Nor let us try the patience of the Lord too far, as some of them tried it, with the result that they &lsquo;were, one after another, destroyed by the snakes.&rsquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.10.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>And do not murmur, as some of them murmured, and so &lsquo;were destroyed by the Angel of Death.&rsquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.10.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>These things happened to them by way of warning, and were recorded to serve as a caution to us, in whose days the close of the ages has come.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.10.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>Therefore let the man who thinks that he stands take care that he does not fall.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.10.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>No temptation has come upon you that is not common to all mankind. God will not fail you, and he will not allow you to be tempted beyond your strength; but, when he sends the temptation, he will also provide the way of escape, so that you may have strength to endure.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.10.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>Therefore, my dear friends, shun the worship of idols.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.10.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>I speak to you as man of discernment; form your own judgment about what I am saying.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.10.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span>In the Cup of Blessing which we bless, is not there a sharing in the blood of the Christ? And in the Bread which we break, is not there a sharing in the Body of the Christ?</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.10.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span>The Bread is one, and we, though many, are one body; for we all partake of that one Bread.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.10.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span>Look at the people of Israel. Do not those who eat the sacrifices share with the altar?</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.10.19"><span class="verse-num">19&nbsp;</span>What do I mean? you ask. Than an offering made to an idol, or the idol itself, is anything?</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.10.20"><span class="verse-num">20&nbsp;</span>No; what I say is that the sacrifices offered by the Gentiles &lsquo;are offered to demons and to a Being who is no God,&rsquo; and I do not want you to share with demons.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.10.21"><span class="verse-num">21&nbsp;</span>You cannot drink both the Cup of the Lord and the cup of demons. You cannot partake at the Table of the Lord and at the table of demons.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.10.22"><span class="verse-num">22&nbsp;</span>Or &lsquo;are we to rouse the jealousy of the Lord&rsquo;? Are we stronger than he?</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.10.23"><span class="verse-num">23&nbsp;</span>Everything is allowable! Yes, but everything is not profitable. Everything is allowable! Yes, but everything does not build up character.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.10.24"><span class="verse-num">24&nbsp;</span>A man must not study his own interests, but the interests of others.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.10.25"><span class="verse-num">25&nbsp;</span>Eat anything that is sold in the market, without making inquiries to satisfy your scruples;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.10.26"><span class="verse-num">26&nbsp;</span>for &lsquo;the earth, with all that is in it, belongs to the Lord.&rsquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.10.27"><span class="verse-num">27&nbsp;</span>If an unbeliever invites you to his house and you consent to go, eat anything that is put before you, without making inquiries to satisfy your scruples.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.10.28"><span class="verse-num">28&nbsp;</span>But, if any one should say to you &lsquo;This has been offered in sacrifice to an idol,&rsquo; then, for the sake of the speaker and his scruples, do not eat it.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.10.29"><span class="verse-num">29&nbsp;</span>I do not say &lsquo;your&rsquo; scruples, but &lsquo;his.&rsquo; For why should the freedom that I claim be condemned by the scruples of another?</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.10.30"><span class="verse-num">30&nbsp;</span>If, for my part, I take the food thankfully, why should I be abused for eating that for which I give thanks?</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.10.31"><span class="verse-num">31&nbsp;</span>Whether, then, you eat or drink or whatever you do, do everything to the honor of God.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.10.32"><span class="verse-num">32&nbsp;</span>Do not cause offence either to Jews or Greeks or to the Church of God;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.10.33"><span class="verse-num">33&nbsp;</span>for I, also, try to please everybody in everything, not seeking my own advantage, but that of men in general, that they may be saved.</span>

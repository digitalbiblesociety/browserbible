<h2 class="chapter-num">10</h2>
<p>
<span class="verse 1Cor_10_1" data-osis="1Cor.10.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>I want you to bear in mind, friends, that all our ancestors were beneath the cloud, and all passed through the sea;</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_10_2" data-osis="1Cor.10.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>that in the cloud and in the sea they all underwent baptism as followers of Moses;</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_10_3" data-osis="1Cor.10.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>and that they all ate the same supernatural food,</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_10_4" data-osis="1Cor.10.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>and all drank the same supernatural water, for they used to drink from a supernatural rock which followed them, and that rock was the Christ.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_10_5" data-osis="1Cor.10.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>Yet with most of them God was displeased; for they were ‘struck down in the desert.’</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_10_6" data-osis="1Cor.10.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>Now these things happened as warnings to us, to teach us not to long for evil things as our forefathers longed.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_10_7" data-osis="1Cor.10.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>Do not become idolaters, as some of them became. Scripture says  —<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘The people sat down to eat and drink, and stood up to dance.’ <br /><br /></span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_10_8" data-osis="1Cor.10.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>Nor let us act immorally, as some of them acted, with the result that twenty-three thousand of them fell dead in a single day.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_10_9" data-osis="1Cor.10.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>Nor let us try the patience of the Lord too far, as some of them tried it, with the result that they ‘were, one after another, destroyed by the snakes.’</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_10_10" data-osis="1Cor.10.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>And do not murmur, as some of them murmured, and so ‘were destroyed by the angel of death.’</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_10_11" data-osis="1Cor.10.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>These things happened to them by way of warning, and were recorded to serve as a caution to us, in whose days the close of the ages has come.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse 1Cor_10_12" data-osis="1Cor.10.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>Therefore let the person who thinks that they stand take care that they do not fall.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_10_13" data-osis="1Cor.10.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>No temptation has come upon you that is not common to all humanity. God will not fail you, and he will not allow you to be tempted beyond your strength; but, when he sends the temptation, he will also provide the way of escape, so that you may have strength to endure.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_10_14" data-osis="1Cor.10.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>Therefore, my dear friends, shun the worship of idols.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_10_15" data-osis="1Cor.10.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>I speak to you as man of discernment; form your own judgment about what I am saying.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_10_16" data-osis="1Cor.10.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>In the cup of blessing which we bless, is not there a sharing in the blood of the Christ? And in the bread which we break, is not there a sharing in the body of the Christ?</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_10_17" data-osis="1Cor.10.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>The bread is one, and we, though many, are one body; for we all partake of that one bread.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_10_18" data-osis="1Cor.10.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>Look at the people of Israel. Do not those who eat the sacrifices share with the altar?</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_10_19" data-osis="1Cor.10.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>What do I mean?  That an offering made to an idol, or the idol itself, is anything?</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_10_20" data-osis="1Cor.10.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>No; what I say is that the sacrifices offered by the Gentiles ‘are offered to demons and to a being who is no God,’ and I do not want you to share with demons.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_10_21" data-osis="1Cor.10.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>You cannot drink both the Cup of the Lord and the cup of demons. You cannot partake at the Table of the Lord and at the table of demons.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_10_22" data-osis="1Cor.10.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>Or ‘are we to rouse the jealousy of the Lord’? Are we stronger than he?</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse 1Cor_10_23" data-osis="1Cor.10.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>Everything is allowable! Yes, but everything is not profitable. Everything is allowable! Yes, but everything does not build up character.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_10_24" data-osis="1Cor.10.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span>A person must not study their own interests, but the interests of others.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse 1Cor_10_25" data-osis="1Cor.10.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span>Eat anything that is sold in the market, without making inquiries to satisfy your scruples;</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_10_26" data-osis="1Cor.10.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span>for ‘the earth, with all that is in it, belongs to the Lord.’</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_10_27" data-osis="1Cor.10.27"><span class="verse-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span>If an unbeliever invites you to his house and you consent to go, eat anything that is put before you, without making inquiries to satisfy your scruples.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_10_28" data-osis="1Cor.10.28"><span class="verse-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span>But, if anyone should say to you ‘This has been offered in sacrifice to an idol,’ then, for the sake of the speaker and his scruples, do not eat it.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_10_29" data-osis="1Cor.10.29"><span class="verse-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span>I do not say ‘your’ scruples, but ‘his.’ For why should the freedom that I claim be condemned by the scruples of another?</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_10_30" data-osis="1Cor.10.30"><span class="verse-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span>If, for my part, I take the food thankfully, why should I be abused for eating that for which I give thanks?</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse 1Cor_10_31" data-osis="1Cor.10.31"><span class="verse-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span>Whether, then, you eat or drink or whatever you do, do everything to the honor of God.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_10_32" data-osis="1Cor.10.32"><span class="verse-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span>Do not cause offense either to Jews or Greeks or to the church of God;</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_10_33" data-osis="1Cor.10.33"><span class="verse-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span>for I, also, try to please everybody in everything, not seeking my own advantage, but do what is best for others, so that they may be saved.</span>

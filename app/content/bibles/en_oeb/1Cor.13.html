<p>
<span class="verse 1Cor_13_1" data-osis="1Cor.13.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>Though I speak in the ‘tongues’ of people, or even of angels, yet have not love, I have become mere echoing brass, or a clanging cymbal!</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_13_2" data-osis="1Cor.13.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>Even though I have the gift of preaching, and fathom all hidden truths and all the depths of knowledge; even though I have such faith as might move mountains, yet have not love, I am nothing!</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_13_3" data-osis="1Cor.13.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>Even though I dole my substance to the poor, even though I sacrifice my body in order to boast, yet have not love, it avails me nothing!</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_13_4" data-osis="1Cor.13.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>love is long-suffering, and kind; love is never envious, never boastful, never conceited, never behaves unbecomingly;</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_13_5" data-osis="1Cor.13.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>love is never self-seeking, never provoked, never reckons up her wrongs;</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_13_6" data-osis="1Cor.13.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>love never rejoices at evil, but rejoices in the triumph of truth;</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_13_7" data-osis="1Cor.13.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>love bears with all things, every trustful, ever hopeful, ever patient.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_13_8" data-osis="1Cor.13.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>love never fails. But, whether it be the gift of preaching, it will be done with; whether it be the gift of ‘tongues,’ it will cease; whether it be knowledge, it, too, will be done with.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_13_9" data-osis="1Cor.13.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>For our knowledge is incomplete, and our preaching is incomplete,</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_13_10" data-osis="1Cor.13.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>but, when the perfect has come, that which is incomplete will be done with.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_13_11" data-osis="1Cor.13.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>When I was a child, I talked as a child, I felt as a child, I reasoned as a child; now that I am a man, I have done with childish ways.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_13_12" data-osis="1Cor.13.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>As yet we see, in a mirror, dimly, but then — face to face! As yet my knowledge is incomplete, but then I will know in full, as I have been fully known.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_13_13" data-osis="1Cor.13.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>Meanwhile faith, hope, and love endure — these three, but the greatest of these is love.</span>

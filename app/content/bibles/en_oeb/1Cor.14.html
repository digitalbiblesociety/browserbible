<p>
<span class="verse 1Cor_14_1" data-osis="1Cor.14.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>Seek this love earnestly, and strive for spiritual gifts, above all for the gift of preaching.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_14_2" data-osis="1Cor.14.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>The person who, when speaking, uses the gift of ‘tongues’ is speaking, not to people, but to God, for no one understands them; yet in spirit they are speaking of hidden truths.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_14_3" data-osis="1Cor.14.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>But those who preach are speaking to their fellow men and women words that will build up faith, and give them comfort and encouragement.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_14_4" data-osis="1Cor.14.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>Those who, when speaking, use the gift of ‘tongues’ builds up their own faith, while those who preach build up the faith of the church.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_14_5" data-osis="1Cor.14.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>Now I want you all to speak in ‘tongues,’ but much more I wish that you should preach. A preacher is worth more than one who speaks in ‘tongues,’ unless they interprets their words, so that the faith of the church may be built up.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_14_6" data-osis="1Cor.14.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>This being so, friends, what good will I do you, if I come to you and speak in ‘tongues,’ unless my words convey some revelation, or knowledge, or take the form of preaching or teaching?</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_14_7" data-osis="1Cor.14.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>Even with inanimate things, such as a flute or a harp, though they produce sounds, yet unless the notes are quite distinct, how can the tune played on the flute or the harp be recognized?</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_14_8" data-osis="1Cor.14.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>If the bugle sounds a doubtful call, who will prepare for battle?</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_14_9" data-osis="1Cor.14.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>And so with you; unless, in using the gift of ‘tongues,’ you utter intelligible words, how can what you say be understood? You will be speaking to the winds!</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_14_10" data-osis="1Cor.14.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>There is, for instance, a certain number of different languages in the world, and not one of them fails to convey meaning.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_14_11" data-osis="1Cor.14.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>If, however, I do not happen to know the language, I will be a foreigner to those who speak it, and they will be foreigners to me.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_14_12" data-osis="1Cor.14.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>And so with you; since your are striving for spiritual gifts, be eager to excel in such as will build up the faith of the church.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_14_13" data-osis="1Cor.14.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>Therefore let him who, when speaking, uses the gift of ‘tongues’ pray for ability to interpret them.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_14_14" data-osis="1Cor.14.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>If, when praying, I use the gift of ‘tongues,’ my spirit indeed prays, but my mind is a blank.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_14_15" data-osis="1Cor.14.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>What, then, is my conclusion? Simply this — I will pray with my spirit, but with my mind as well; I will sing with my spirit, but with my mind as well.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_14_16" data-osis="1Cor.14.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>If you bless God with your spirit only, how can people in the congregation who are without your gift say ‘Amen’ to your thanksgiving? They do not know what you are saying!</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_14_17" data-osis="1Cor.14.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>Your thanksgiving may be excellent, but the other is not helped by it.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_14_18" data-osis="1Cor.14.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>Thank God, I use the gift of ‘tongues’ more than any of you.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_14_19" data-osis="1Cor.14.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>But at a meeting of the church I would rather speak five words with my mind, and so teach others, than ten thousand words when using the gift of ‘tongues.’</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse 1Cor_14_20" data-osis="1Cor.14.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>My friends, do not show yourselves children in understanding. In wickedness be infants, but in understanding show yourselves adults.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_14_21" data-osis="1Cor.14.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>It is said in the law  —<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘In strange tongues and by the lips of strangers will I speak to this people, but even then they will not listen to me, says the Lord.’ <br /><br /></span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_14_22" data-osis="1Cor.14.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>Therefore the gift of the ‘tongues’ is intended as a sign, not for those who believe in Christ, but for those who do not, while the gift of preaching is intended as a sign, not for those who do not believe in Christ, but for those who do.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_14_23" data-osis="1Cor.14.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>So, when the whole church meets, if all present use the gift of ‘tongues,’ and some people who are without the gift, or who are unbelievers, come in, will not they say that you are mad?</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_14_24" data-osis="1Cor.14.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span>While, if all those present use the gift of preaching, and an unbeliever, or someone without the gift, comes in, they are convinced of their sinfulness by them all, they are called to account by them all;</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_14_25" data-osis="1Cor.14.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span>the secrets of their heart are revealed, and then, throwing themselves on their face, they will worship God, and declare ‘God is indeed among you!’</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse 1Cor_14_26" data-osis="1Cor.14.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span>What do I suggest, then, friends? Whenever you meet for worship, each of you comes, either with a hymn, or a lesson, or a revelation, or the gift of ‘tongues,’ or the interpretation of them; let everything be directed to the building up of faith.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_14_27" data-osis="1Cor.14.27"><span class="verse-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span>If any of you use the gift of ‘tongues,’ not more than two, or at the most three, should do so — each speaking in his turn — and some one should interpret them.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_14_28" data-osis="1Cor.14.28"><span class="verse-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span>If there is no one able to interpret what is said, they should remain silent at the meeting of the church, and speak to themselves and to God.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_14_29" data-osis="1Cor.14.29"><span class="verse-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span>Of preachers two or three should speak, and the rest should weigh well what is said.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_14_30" data-osis="1Cor.14.30"><span class="verse-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span>But, if some revelation is made to another person as he sits there, the first speaker should stop.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_14_31" data-osis="1Cor.14.31"><span class="verse-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span>For you can all preach in turn, so that all may learn some lesson and all receive encouragement.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_14_32" data-osis="1Cor.14.32"><span class="verse-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span>(The spirit that moves the preachers is within the preachers’ control;</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_14_33" data-osis="1Cor.14.33"><span class="verse-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span>for God is not a God of disorder, but of peace.) This custom prevails in all the churches of Christ’s people.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_14_34" data-osis="1Cor.14.34"><span class="verse-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span>At the meetings of the church married women should remain silent, for they are not allowed to speak in public; they should take a subordinate place, as the law itself directs.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_14_35" data-osis="1Cor.14.35"><span class="verse-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span>If they want information on any point, they should ask their husbands about it at home; for it is unbecoming for a married woman to speak at a meeting of the church.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_14_36" data-osis="1Cor.14.36"><span class="verse-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span>What! Did God’s message to the world originate with you? Or did it find its way to none but you?</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse 1Cor_14_37" data-osis="1Cor.14.37"><span class="verse-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span>If anyone thinks that he has the gift of preaching or any other spiritual gift, let him recognize that what I am now saying to you is a command from the Lord.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_14_38" data-osis="1Cor.14.38"><span class="verse-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span>Anyone who ignores it may be ignored.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_14_39" data-osis="1Cor.14.39"><span class="verse-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span>Therefore, my friends, strive for the gift of preaching, and yet do not forbid speaking in ‘tongues.’</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_14_40" data-osis="1Cor.14.40"><span class="verse-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span>Let everything be done in a proper and orderly manner.</span>

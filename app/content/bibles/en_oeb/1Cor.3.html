<h2 class="chapter-num">3</h2>
<p>
<span class="verse 1Cor_3_1" data-osis="1Cor.3.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>But I, my friends, could not speak to you as people with spiritual insight, but only as worldly-minded — mere infants in the faith of Christ.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_3_2" data-osis="1Cor.3.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>I fed you with milk, not with solid food, for you were not then able to take it.</span>
</p>
<p>No, and even now you are not able; you are still worldly.
<span class="verse 1Cor_3_3" data-osis="1Cor.3.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>While there exist among you jealousy and party feeling, is it not true that you are worldly, and are acting merely as other people do?</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_3_4" data-osis="1Cor.3.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>When one says ‘I follow Paul,’ and another ‘I follow Apollos,’ aren’t you like other people?</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_3_5" data-osis="1Cor.3.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>What, I ask, is Apollos? Or what is Paul? Servants through whom you were led to accept the faith; and that only as the Lord helped each of you.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_3_6" data-osis="1Cor.3.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>I planted, and Apollos watered, but it was God who caused the growth.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_3_7" data-osis="1Cor.3.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>Therefore neither the one who plants, nor the one who waters, counts for anything, but only God who causes the growth.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_3_8" data-osis="1Cor.3.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>In this the person who plants and the person who waters are one; yet each will receive their own reward in proportion to their own labor.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_3_9" data-osis="1Cor.3.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>For we are God’s fellow workers; you are God’s harvest field, God’s building.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse 1Cor_3_10" data-osis="1Cor.3.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>In fulfillment of the charge which God had entrusted to me, I laid the foundation like a skillful master; but someone else is now building on it. Let everyone take care how they build;</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_3_11" data-osis="1Cor.3.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>for no one can lay any other foundation than the one already laid — Jesus Christ.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_3_12" data-osis="1Cor.3.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>Whatever is used by those who build on this foundation, whether gold, silver, costly stones, wood, hay, or straw,</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_3_13" data-osis="1Cor.3.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>the quality of each man’s work will become known, for the day will make it plain; because that day is to be ushered in with fire, and the fire itself will test the quality of every man’s work.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_3_14" data-osis="1Cor.3.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>If anyone’s work, which they have built on that foundation, still remains, they will gain a reward.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_3_15" data-osis="1Cor.3.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>If anyone’s work is burnt up, they will suffer loss; though they themselves will escape, but only as one who has passed through fire.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse 1Cor_3_16" data-osis="1Cor.3.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>Don’t you know that you are God’s Temple, and that God’s Spirit has his home in you?</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_3_17" data-osis="1Cor.3.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>If any one destroys the Temple of God, God will destroy them; for the Temple of God is sacred, and so also are you.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_3_18" data-osis="1Cor.3.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>Let no one deceive himself. If any one among you imagines that, as regards this world, they are wise, let them become a ‘fool,’ that they may become wise.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_3_19" data-osis="1Cor.3.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>For in God’s sight this world’s wisdom is folly. Scripture tells of  —<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘One who catches the wise in their own craftiness,’ <br /><br /></span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_3_20" data-osis="1Cor.3.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>And it says again  —<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘The Lord sees how fruitless are the deliberations of the wise.’<br /><br /></span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_3_21" data-osis="1Cor.3.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>Therefore let no one boast about people; for all things are yours —</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_3_22" data-osis="1Cor.3.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or the present, or the future — all things are yours!</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_3_23" data-osis="1Cor.3.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>But you are Christ’s and Christ is God’s.</span>

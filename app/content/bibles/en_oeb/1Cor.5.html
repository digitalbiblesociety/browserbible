<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.5.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>There is a wide-spread report respecting a case of immorality among you, and that, too, of a kind that does not occur even among the Gentiles-a man, I hear, is living with his father&rsquo;s wife!</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.5.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>Instead of grieving over it and taking steps for the expulsion of the man who has done this thing, is it possible that you are still puffed up?</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.5.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>For I myself, though absent in body, have been present with you in spirit, and in the name of our Lord Jesus I have already passed judgment, just as if I had been present, upon the man who has acted in this way.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.5.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>I have decided-having been present in spirit at your meetings, when the power of the Lord Jesus was with us-</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.5.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>To deliver such a man as this over to Satan, that what is sensual in him may be destroyed, so that his spirit may be saved at the Day of the Lord.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.5.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>Your boasting is unseemly. Do not you know that even a little leaven leavens all the dough?</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.5.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>Get rid entirely of the old leaven, so that you may be like new dough-free from leaven, as in truth you are. For our Passover Lamb is already sacrificed-Christ himself;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.5.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>therefore let us keep our festival, not with the leaven of former days, nor with the leaven of vice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.5.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>I told you, in my letter, not to associate with immoral people- -</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.5.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>Not, of course, meaning men of the world who are in immoral, or who are covetous and grasping, or who worship idols; for then you would have to leave the world altogether.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.5.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>But, as things are, I say that you are not to associate with any one who, although a Brother in name, is immoral, or covetous, or an idolater, or abusive, or a drunkard, or grasping-no, not even to sit at table with such people.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.5.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>What have I to do with judging those outside the Church? Is it not for you to judge those who are within the Church,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.5.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>while God judges those who are outside? &lsquo;Put away the wicked man from among you.&rsquo;</span>

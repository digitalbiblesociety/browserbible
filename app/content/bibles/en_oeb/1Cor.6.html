<p>
<span class="verse 1Cor_6_1" data-osis="1Cor.6.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>Can it be that, when one of you has a dispute with another, they dare to have their case tried before the heathen, instead of before Christ’s people?</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_6_2" data-osis="1Cor.6.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>Don’t you know that Christ’s people will try the world? And if the world is to be tried by you, are you unfit to try the most trivial cases?</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_6_3" data-osis="1Cor.6.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>Don’t you know that we are to try angels — to say nothing of the affairs of this life?</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_6_4" data-osis="1Cor.6.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>Why, then, if you have cases relating to the affairs of this life, do you set to try them those who carry no weight with the church? To your shame I ask it.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_6_5" data-osis="1Cor.6.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>Can it be that there is not one among you wise enough to decide between two of their fellow followers?</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_6_6" data-osis="1Cor.6.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>Must a follower sue a fellow follower? In front of unbelievers?</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_6_7" data-osis="1Cor.6.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>To begin with, it is undoubtedly a loss to you to have lawsuits with one another. Why not rather let yourselves be wronged? Why not rather let yourselves be cheated?</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_6_8" data-osis="1Cor.6.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>Instead of this, you wrong and cheat others yourselves — yes, even other followers!</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_6_9" data-osis="1Cor.6.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>Don’t you know that wrong-doers will have no share in God’s kingdom? Do not be deceived. No one who is immoral, or an idolater, or an adulterer, or licentious, or a sexual pervert,</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_6_10" data-osis="1Cor.6.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>or a thief, or covetous, or a drunkard, or abusive, or grasping, will have any share in God’s kingdom.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_6_11" data-osis="1Cor.6.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>Such some of you used to be; but you washed yourselves clean. You became Christ’s people! You were pronounced righteous through the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, and through the Spirit of our God!</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_6_12" data-osis="1Cor.6.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>Everything is allowable for me! Yes, but everything is not profitable. Everything is allowable for me! Yes, but for my part, I will not let myself be enslaved by anything.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_6_13" data-osis="1Cor.6.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>Food exists for the stomach, and the stomach for food; but God will put an end to both the one and the other. The body, however, exists, not for immorality, but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body;</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_6_14" data-osis="1Cor.6.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>and, as God has raised the Lord, so he will raise up us also by the exercise of his power.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_6_15" data-osis="1Cor.6.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>Don’t you know that your bodies are Christ’s members? Am I, then, to take the members that belong to the Christ and make them the members of a prostitute? Heaven forbid!</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_6_16" data-osis="1Cor.6.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>Or don’t you know that a man who unites himself with a prostitute is one with her in body (for ‘the two,’ it is said, ‘will become one’);</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_6_17" data-osis="1Cor.6.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>while a man who is united with the Lord is one with him in spirit?</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_6_18" data-osis="1Cor.6.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>Shun all immorality. Every other sin that people commit is something outside the body; but an immoral person sins against their own body.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_6_19" data-osis="1Cor.6.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>Again, don’t you know that your body is a shrine of the Holy Spirit that is within you – the Spirit which you have from God?</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_6_20" data-osis="1Cor.6.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>Moreover, you are not your own masters; you were bought, and the price was paid. Therefore, honor God in your bodies.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.7.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>With reference to the subjects about which you wrote to me: It would be well for a man to remain single.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.7.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>But, owing to the prevalence of immorality, I advise every man to have his own wife, and every woman her husband.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.7.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>A husband should give his wife her due, and a wife her husband.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.7.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>It is not the wife, but the husband, who exercises power over her body; and so, too, it is not the husband, but the wife, who exercises power over his body.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.7.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>Do not deprive each other of what is due-unless it is only for a time and by mutual consent, so that your minds may be free for prayer till you again live as man and wife-lest Satan should take advantage of your want of self-control and tempt you.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.7.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>I say this, however, as a concession, not as a command.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.7.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>I should wish every one to be just what I am myself. But every one has his own gift from God-one in one way, and one in another.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.7.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>My advice, then, to those who are not married, and to widows, is this: It would be well for them to remain as I am myself.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.7.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>But, if they cannot control themselves, let them marry, for it is better to marry than to be consumed with passion.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.7.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>To those who are married my direction is-yet it is not mine, but the Master&rsquo;s-that a woman is not to leave her husband</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.7.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>(If she has done so, let her remain as she is, or else be reconciled to her husband) and also that a man is not to divorce his wife.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.7.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>To all others I say-I, not the Master-If a Brother is married to a woman, who is an unbeliever but willing to live with him, he should not divorce her;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.7.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>and a woman who is married to a man, who is an unbeliever but willing to live with her, should not divorce her husband.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.7.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>For, through his wife, the husband who is an unbeliever has become associated with Christ&rsquo;s People; and the wife who is an unbeliever has become associated with Christ&rsquo;s People through our Brother whom she has married. Otherwise your children would be &lsquo;defiled,&rsquo; but, as it is, they belong to Christ&rsquo;s People.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.7.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>However, if the unbeliever wishes to be separated, let him be so. Under such circumstances neither the Brother nor the Sister is bound; God has called you to live in peace.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.7.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span>How can you tell, wife, whether you may not save your husband? and how can you tell, husband, whether you may not save your wife?</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.7.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span>In any case, a man should continue to live in the condition which the Lord has allotted to him, and in which he was when God called him. This is the rule that I lay down in every Church.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.7.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span>Was a man already circumcised when he was called? Then he should not efface his circumcision. Has a man been called when uncircumcised? Then he should not be circumcised.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.7.19"><span class="verse-num">19&nbsp;</span>Circumcision is nothing; the want of it is nothing; but to keep the commands of God is everything.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.7.20"><span class="verse-num">20&nbsp;</span>Let every one remain in that condition of life in which he was when the Call came to him.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.7.21"><span class="verse-num">21&nbsp;</span>Were you a slave when you were called? Do not let that trouble you. No, even if you are able to gain your freedom, still do your best.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.7.22"><span class="verse-num">22&nbsp;</span>For the man who was a slave when he was called to the master&rsquo;s service is the Master&rsquo;s freed-man; so, too, the man who was free when called is Christ&rsquo;s slave.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.7.23"><span class="verse-num">23&nbsp;</span>You were bought, and the price was paid. Do not let yourselves become slaves to men.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.7.24"><span class="verse-num">24&nbsp;</span>Brothers, let every one remain in the condition in which he was when he was called, in close communion with God.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.7.25"><span class="verse-num">25&nbsp;</span>With regard to unmarried women, I have no command from the Master to give you, but I tell you my opinion, and it is that of a man whom the Master in his mercy has made worthy to be trusted.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.7.26"><span class="verse-num">26&nbsp;</span>I think, then, that, in view of the time of suffering that has now come upon us, what I have already said is best-that a man should remain as he is.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.7.27"><span class="verse-num">27&nbsp;</span>Are you married to a wife? Then do not seek to be separated. Are you separated from a wife? Then do not seek for a wife.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.7.28"><span class="verse-num">28&nbsp;</span>still, if you should marry, that is not wrong; nor, if a young woman marries, is that wrong. But those who marry will have much trouble to bear, and my wish is to spare you.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.7.29"><span class="verse-num">29&nbsp;</span>What I mean, Brothers, is this-The time is short. Meanwhile, let those who have wives live as if they had none,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.7.30"><span class="verse-num">30&nbsp;</span>those who are weeping as if not weeping, those who are rejoicing as if not rejoicing, those who buy as if not possessing,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.7.31"><span class="verse-num">31&nbsp;</span>and those who use the good things of the world as using them sparingly; for this world as we see it is passing away.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.7.32"><span class="verse-num">32&nbsp;</span>I want you to be free from anxiety. The unmarried man is anxious about the Master&rsquo;s Cause, desiring to please him;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.7.33"><span class="verse-num">33&nbsp;</span>while the married man is anxious about worldly matters, desiring to please his wife;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.7.34"><span class="verse-num">34&nbsp;</span>and so his interests are divided. Again, the unmarried woman, whether she is old or young, is anxious about the Master&rsquo;s Cause, striving to be pure both in body and in spirit, while the married woman is anxious about worldly matters, desiring to please her husband.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.7.35"><span class="verse-num">35&nbsp;</span>I say this for your own benefit, not with any intention of putting a halter round your necks, but in order to secure for the Master seemly and constant devotion, free from all distraction.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.7.36"><span class="verse-num">36&nbsp;</span>If, however, a father thinks that he is not acting fairly by his unmarried daughter, when she is past her youth, and if under these circumstances her marriage ought to take place, let him act as he thinks right. He is doing nothing wrong-let the marriage take place.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.7.37"><span class="verse-num">37&nbsp;</span>On the other hand, a father, who has definitely made up his mind, and is under no compulsion, but is free to carry out his own wishes, and who has come to the decision, in his own mind, to keep his unmarried daughter at home will be doing right.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.7.38"><span class="verse-num">38&nbsp;</span>In short, the one who consents to his daughter&rsquo;s marriage is doing right, and yet the other will be doing better.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.7.39"><span class="verse-num">39&nbsp;</span>A wife is bound to her husband as long as he lives; but, if the husband should pass to his rest, the widow is free to marry any one she wishes, provided he is a believer.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.7.40"><span class="verse-num">40&nbsp;</span>Yet she will be happier if she remains as she is-in my opinion, for I think that I also have the Spirit of God.</span>

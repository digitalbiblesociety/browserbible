<h2 class="chapter-num">8</h2>
<p>
<span class="verse 1Cor_8_1" data-osis="1Cor.8.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>With reference to food that has been offered in sacrifice to idols — We are aware that all of us have knowledge! Knowledge breeds conceit, while love builds up character.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_8_2" data-osis="1Cor.8.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>If someone thinks that they know anything, they have not yet reached that knowledge which they ought to have reached.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_8_3" data-osis="1Cor.8.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>On the other hand, if a person loves God, they are known by God.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_8_4" data-osis="1Cor.8.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>With reference, then, to eating food that has been offered to idols — we are aware that an idol is nothing in the world, and that there is no God but one.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_8_5" data-osis="1Cor.8.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>Even supposing that there are so-called ‘gods’ either in heaven or on earth — and there are many such ‘gods’ and ‘lords’ —</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_8_6" data-osis="1Cor.8.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>Yet for us there is only one God, the Father, from whom all things come (and for him we live), and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom all things come (and through him we live).</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_8_7" data-osis="1Cor.8.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>Still, it is not everyone that has this knowledge. Some people, because of their association with idols, continued down to the present time, eat the food as food offered to an idol; and their consciences, while still weak, are dulled.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_8_8" data-osis="1Cor.8.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>What we eat, however, will not bring us nearer to God. We lose nothing by not eating this food, and we gain nothing by eating it.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_8_9" data-osis="1Cor.8.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>But take care that this right of yours does not become in any way a stumbling-block to the weak.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_8_10" data-osis="1Cor.8.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>For if some one should see you who possess this knowledge, feasting in an idol’s temple, will not their conscience, if they are weak, become so hardened that they, too, will eat food offered to idols?</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_8_11" data-osis="1Cor.8.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>And so, through this knowledge of yours, the weak person is ruined — someone for whose sake Christ died!</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_8_12" data-osis="1Cor.8.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>In this way, by sinning against your fellow followers of the Lord and injuring their consciences, while still weak, you sin against Christ.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_8_13" data-osis="1Cor.8.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>Therefore, if what I eat makes a follower of the Lord fall, rather than make them fall, I will never eat meat again.</span>

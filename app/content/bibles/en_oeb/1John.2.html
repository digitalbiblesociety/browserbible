<span class="verse 1John_2_1" data-osis="1John.2.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>My children, I am writing to you to keep you from sinning; but if anyone should sin, we have one who can plead for us with the Father — Jesus Christ, the righteous —</span>
<span class="verse 1John_2_2" data-osis="1John.2.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>and he is the atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not for ours only, but for those of the whole world besides.</span>
<span class="verse 1John_2_3" data-osis="1John.2.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>And by this we know that we have learned to know him — by our laying his commands to heart.</span>
<span class="verse 1John_2_4" data-osis="1John.2.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>The person who says ‘I know Jesus,’ but does not lay his commands to heart, is a liar, and the truth has no place in them;</span>
<span class="verse 1John_2_5" data-osis="1John.2.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>but, whenever a person lays his message to heart, in that person the love of God has indeed reached its perfection. By this we know that we are in union with God —</span>
<span class="verse 1John_2_6" data-osis="1John.2.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>He who professes to maintain union with God is himself bound to live as Christ lived.</span>
<span class="verse 1John_2_7" data-osis="1John.2.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>Dear friends, it is no new command that I am writing to you, but an old command, which you have had from the first. That old command is the message to which you listened.</span>
<span class="verse 1John_2_8" data-osis="1John.2.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>Yet, in a way, it is a new command that I am writing to you —  manifest in Christ’s life and in your own — for the darkness is passing away and the true light is already shining.</span>
<span class="verse 1John_2_9" data-osis="1John.2.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>The person who says that they are in the light, and yet hates others, is in the darkness even now.</span>
<span class="verse 1John_2_10" data-osis="1John.2.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>The person who loves others is always in the light, and there is nothing within them to cause them to stumble;</span>
<span class="verse 1John_2_11" data-osis="1John.2.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>while the person who hates others is in the darkness, and is living in the darkness, and does not know where they are going, because the darkness prevents them seeing.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse 1John_2_12" data-osis="1John.2.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>I am writing, God's children, to you, because your sins have been forgiven you for Christ’s sake.</span>
<span class="verse 1John_2_13" data-osis="1John.2.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>I am writing, adults in the faith, to you, because you have learned to know him who has been from the beginning. I am writing, young ones in the faith, to you, because you have conquered the evil one. I write, children, to you, because you have learned to know the Father.</span>
<span class="verse 1John_2_14" data-osis="1John.2.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>I write, adults in the faith, to you, because you have learned to know him who has been from the beginning. I write, young ones in the faith, to you, because you are strong, and God’s message is always in your hearts, and you have conquered the evil one.</span>
<span class="verse 1John_2_15" data-osis="1John.2.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>Do not love the world or what the world can offer. When anyone loves the world, there is no love for the Father in them;</span>
<span class="verse 1John_2_16" data-osis="1John.2.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>for all that the world can offer — the gratification of the earthly nature, the gratification of the eye, the pretentious life — belongs, not to the Father, but to the world.</span>
<span class="verse 1John_2_17" data-osis="1John.2.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>And the world, and all that it gratifies, is passing away, but they who do God’s will remains for ever.</span>
</p>
<h4>Warnings against Antichrist</h4>
<span class="verse 1John_2_18" data-osis="1John.2.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>My children, these are the last days. You were told that an antichrist was coming; and many antichrists have already arisen. By that we know that these are the last days.</span>
<span class="verse 1John_2_19" data-osis="1John.2.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>From us, it is true, they went out, but they had never belonged to us; for, if they had belonged to us, they would have remained among us. They left us that it might be made clear that they do not, any of them, belong to us.</span>
<span class="verse 1John_2_20" data-osis="1John.2.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>You, however, have received consecration from the Holy One.</span>
<span class="verse 1John_2_21" data-osis="1John.2.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>You all know — But I am not writing to you because you do not know the truth, but because you do know it, and because nothing false can come from the truth.</span>
<p>
<span class="verse 1John_2_22" data-osis="1John.2.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>Who is a liar, if not the person who rejects the truth that Jesus is the Christ? That person is the antichrist — the person who rejects the Father and the Son.</span>
<span class="verse 1John_2_23" data-osis="1John.2.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>No one who rejects the Son has found the Father; the person who acknowledges the Son has found the Father also.</span>
<span class="verse 1John_2_24" data-osis="1John.2.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span>As for you, let what you were told at the first be always in your thoughts. If, then, what you were told at the first is always in your thoughts, you yourselves will maintain your union both with the Son and with the Father.</span>
<span class="verse 1John_2_25" data-osis="1John.2.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span>And this is what he himself promised us — eternal life!</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse 1John_2_26" data-osis="1John.2.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span>In writing this this to you, I have in mind those who are trying to mislead you.</span>
<span class="verse 1John_2_27" data-osis="1John.2.27"><span class="verse-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span>But you — you still retain in your hearts that consecration which you received from the Christ, and are not in need of anyone to teach you; but, since his consecration of you teaches you about everything, and since it is a real consecration, and no lie, then, as it has taught you, maintain your union with him.</span>
<span class="verse 1John_2_28" data-osis="1John.2.28"><span class="verse-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span>Yes, my children, maintain your union with Christ, so that, whenever he appears, our confidence may not fail us, and we may not be ashamed to meet him at his coming.</span>
<span class="verse 1John_2_29" data-osis="1John.2.29"><span class="verse-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span>Knowing him to be righteous, you realize that everyone who lives righteously has received the new life from him.</span>

<h4>A Christian’s Faith and Confidence</h4>
<span class="verse 1John_5_1" data-osis="1John.5.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ has received the new life from God; and everyone who loves him who gave that life loves him who has received it.</span>
<span class="verse 1John_5_2" data-osis="1John.5.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>By this we know that we love God’s children — when we love God and carry out his commands.</span>
<span class="verse 1John_5_3" data-osis="1John.5.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>For to love God is to lay his commands to heart; and his commands are not burdensome,</span>
<span class="verse 1John_5_4" data-osis="1John.5.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>because all that has received the new life from God conquers the world. And this is the power that has conquered the world — our faith!</span>
<span class="verse 1John_5_5" data-osis="1John.5.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>Who is the person that conquers the world but the person who believes that Jesus is the Son of God?</span>
<span class="verse 1John_5_6" data-osis="1John.5.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>He it is whose coming was by water and blood — Jesus Christ himself; not by water only, but by water and by blood. And there is the Spirit also to bear testimony, and the Spirit is truth itself.</span>
<span class="verse 1John_5_7" data-osis="1John.5.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>It is a threefold testimony —</span>
<span class="verse 1John_5_8" data-osis="1John.5.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>that of the Spirit, the water, and the blood — and these three are at one.</span>
<span class="verse 1John_5_9" data-osis="1John.5.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>We accept the testimony of people, but God’s testimony is still stronger; and there is the testimony of God — the fact that he has already borne testimony about his Son.</span>
<span class="verse 1John_5_10" data-osis="1John.5.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>The person who believes in the Son of God has that testimony within them. The person who does not believe God has made God a liar, by refusing to believe in that testimony which he has borne about his Son.</span>
<span class="verse 1John_5_11" data-osis="1John.5.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>And that testimony is that God gave us eternal life, and that this life is in his Son.</span>
<span class="verse 1John_5_12" data-osis="1John.5.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>The person who finds the Son finds life; the person who does not find the Son of God does not find life.</span>
<p>
<span class="verse 1John_5_13" data-osis="1John.5.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>I write this to you so that you may realize that you have found eternal life — you who believe in the name of the Son of God.</span>
<span class="verse 1John_5_14" data-osis="1John.5.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>And this is the confidence with which we approach him, that whenever we ask anything that is in accordance with his will, he listens to us.</span>
<span class="verse 1John_5_15" data-osis="1John.5.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>And if we realize that he listens to us — whatever we ask — we realize that we have what we have asked from him.</span>
<span class="verse 1John_5_16" data-osis="1John.5.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>If anyone sees one of our people committing some sin that is not a deadly sin, they will ask, and so be the means of giving life to them — to any whose sin is not deadly. There is such a thing as deadly sin; about that I do not say that a person should pray.</span>
<span class="verse 1John_5_17" data-osis="1John.5.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>Every wrong action is sin, and there is sin that is not deadly.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse 1John_5_18" data-osis="1John.5.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>We know that no one who has received the new life from God lives in sin. No, the person who has received the new life from God keeps the thought of God in their heart, and then the evil one does not touch them.</span>
<span class="verse 1John_5_19" data-osis="1John.5.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>We realize that we come from God, while all the world is under the influence of the evil one.</span>
<span class="verse 1John_5_20" data-osis="1John.5.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>We realize, too, that the Son of God has come among us, and has given us the discernment to know the true God; and we are in union with the true God by our union with his Son, Jesus Christ. He is the true God and he is eternal life.</span>
<span class="verse 1John_5_21" data-osis="1John.5.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>My children, guard yourselves against false ideas of God.</span>

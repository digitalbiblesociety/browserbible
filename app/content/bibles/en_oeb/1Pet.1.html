<h4>Introduction</h4>
<span class="verse 1Pet_1_1" data-osis="1Pet.1.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>To the people of God who are living abroad, dispersed throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Roman Asia, and Bithynia,</span>
<span class="verse 1Pet_1_2" data-osis="1Pet.1.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>and who were chosen in accordance with the foreknowledge of God the Father, through the consecration of the Spirit, to learn obedience, and to be purified by the sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ, from Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ. May blessing and peace be yours in ever increasing measure.</span>
<h4>The Christian’s Hope of Salvation</h4>
<span class="verse 1Pet_1_3" data-osis="1Pet.1.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>Blessed is the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has, in his great mercy, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,</span>
<span class="verse 1Pet_1_4" data-osis="1Pet.1.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>given us the new life of undying hope, that promises an inheritance, imperishable, stainless, unfading, which has been reserved for you in heaven —</span>
<span class="verse 1Pet_1_5" data-osis="1Pet.1.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>for you who, through faith, are being guarded by the power of God, awaiting a salvation that is ready to be revealed in the last days.</span>
<span class="verse 1Pet_1_6" data-osis="1Pet.1.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>At the thought of this you are full of exultation, though (if it has been necessary) you have suffered for the moment somewhat from various trials;</span>
<span class="verse 1Pet_1_7" data-osis="1Pet.1.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>that the genuineness of your faith — a thing far more precious than gold, which is perishable, yet has to be tested by fire — may win praise and glory and honor at the appearing of Jesus Christ.</span>
<span class="verse 1Pet_1_8" data-osis="1Pet.1.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>Though you have never seen him, yet you love him; though you do not even now see him, yet you believe in him, and exalt with a triumphant happiness too great for words,</span>
<span class="verse 1Pet_1_9" data-osis="1Pet.1.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>as you receive the reward of your faith in the salvation of your souls!</span>
<span class="verse 1Pet_1_10" data-osis="1Pet.1.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>It was this salvation that the prophets, who spoke long ago of the blessing intended for you, sought, and strove to comprehend;</span>
<span class="verse 1Pet_1_11" data-osis="1Pet.1.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>as they strove to discern what that time could be, to which the Spirit of Christ within them was pointing, when foretelling the sufferings that Christ would have to endure, and the glories that would follow.</span>
<span class="verse 1Pet_1_12" data-osis="1Pet.1.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>And it was revealed to them that it was not for themselves, but for you, that they were acting as Ministers of the truths which have now been told to you, by those who, with the help of the Holy Spirit sent from heaven, have brought you the good news — truths into which even angels long to look.</span>
<h4>The Christian’s Character</h4>
<span class="verse 1Pet_1_13" data-osis="1Pet.1.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>Therefore concentrate your minds, with the strictest self-control, and fix your hopes on the blessing that is coming for you at the appearing of Jesus Christ.</span>
<span class="verse 1Pet_1_14" data-osis="1Pet.1.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>Be like obedient children; do not let your lives be shaped by the passions which once swayed you in the days of your ignorance,</span>
<span class="verse 1Pet_1_15" data-osis="1Pet.1.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>but in your whole life show yourselves to be holy, after the pattern of the Holy One from whom you received your call.</span>
<span class="verse 1Pet_1_16" data-osis="1Pet.1.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>For scripture says —<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘You will be holy, because I am holy.’<br /><br /></span>
<span class="verse 1Pet_1_17" data-osis="1Pet.1.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>And since you call on him as ‘Father,’ who judges everyone impartially by what he has done, let respectful awe be the spirit of your lives during the time of your stay on earth.</span>
<span class="verse 1Pet_1_18" data-osis="1Pet.1.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>For you know that it was not by perishable things, such as silver and gold, that you were ransomed from the aimless way of living which was handed down to you from your ancestors,</span>
<span class="verse 1Pet_1_19" data-osis="1Pet.1.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>but by precious blood, as it were of a lamb, unblemished and spotless, the blood of Christ.</span>
<span class="verse 1Pet_1_20" data-osis="1Pet.1.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>Destined for this before the beginning of the world, he has been revealed in these last days for your sakes,</span>
<span class="verse 1Pet_1_21" data-osis="1Pet.1.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>who, through him, are faithful to God who raised him from the dead and gave him honor, so that your faith and hope are now in God.</span>
<p>
<span class="verse 1Pet_1_22" data-osis="1Pet.1.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>Now that, by your obedience to the truth, you have purified your lives, so that there is growing up among you a genuine affection, love one another earnestly with all your hearts;</span>
<span class="verse 1Pet_1_23" data-osis="1Pet.1.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>since your new life has come, not from perishable, but imperishable, seed, through the message of the Everliving God.</span>
<span class="verse 1Pet_1_24" data-osis="1Pet.1.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span>For —<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘All earthly life is but as grass,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and all its splendor as the flower of grass.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grass fades,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;its flower falls,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
<span class="verse 1Pet_1_25" data-osis="1Pet.1.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span>but the teaching of the Lord remains for ever.’<br /><br />And that is the teaching of the good news which has been told to you.</span>

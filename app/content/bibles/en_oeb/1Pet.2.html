<p>
<span class="verse 1Pet_2_1" data-osis="1Pet.2.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>Now that you have done with all malice, all deceitfulness, insincerity, jealous feelings, and all backbiting,</span>
<span class="verse 1Pet_2_2" data-osis="1Pet.2.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>like newly born infants, crave pure spiritual milk, so that you may be enabled by it to grow until you attain salvation —</span>
<span class="verse 1Pet_2_3" data-osis="1Pet.2.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>since ‘you have found by experience that the Lord is kind.’</span>
<span class="verse 1Pet_2_4" data-osis="1Pet.2.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>Come to him, then, as to a living stone, rejected, indeed, by men, but in God’s eyes choice and precious;</span>
<span class="verse 1Pet_2_5" data-osis="1Pet.2.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>and, as living stones, form yourselves into a spiritual house, to be a consecrated priesthood, for the offering of spiritual sacrifices that will be acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.</span>
<span class="verse 1Pet_2_6" data-osis="1Pet.2.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>For there is a passage of scripture that runs —<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘See, I am placing in Zion a choice and precious corner-stone;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And those who believe in him will have no cause for shame.’<br /><br /></span>
<span class="verse 1Pet_2_7" data-osis="1Pet.2.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>It is to you, then, who believe in him that he is precious, but to those who do not believe he is ‘a stone which, though rejected by the builders, has now itself become the corner-stone,’</span>
<span class="verse 1Pet_2_8" data-osis="1Pet.2.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>and ‘a stumbling-block, and a rock which will prove a hindrance.’ They stumble because they do not accept the message. This was the fate destined for them.</span>
<span class="verse 1Pet_2_9" data-osis="1Pet.2.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>But you are ‘a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a consecrated nation, God’s own people,’ entrusted with the proclamation of the goodness of him who called you out of darkness into his wonderful light.</span>
<span class="verse 1Pet_2_10" data-osis="1Pet.2.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>Once you were ‘not a people,’ but now you are ‘God’s people’; once you ‘had not found mercy,’ but now you ‘have found mercy.’</span>
</p>
<h4>Practical Appeals in view of the Dangers of the Times.</h4>
<span class="verse 1Pet_2_11" data-osis="1Pet.2.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>Dear friends, I beg you, as pilgrims and strangers on earth, to refrain from indulging the cravings of your earthly nature, for they make war on the soul.</span>
<span class="verse 1Pet_2_12" data-osis="1Pet.2.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>Let your daily life among the Gentiles be so upright, that, whenever they malign you as evil-doers, they may learn, as they watch, from the uprightness of your conduct, to praise God ‘at the time when he will visit them.’</span>
<p>
<span class="verse 1Pet_2_13" data-osis="1Pet.2.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>Submit to all human institutions for the Lord’s sake, alike to the emperor as the supreme authority,</span>
<span class="verse 1Pet_2_14" data-osis="1Pet.2.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>and to governors as sent by him to punish evil-doers and to commend those who do right.</span>
<span class="verse 1Pet_2_15" data-osis="1Pet.2.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>For God’s will is this — that you should silence the ignorance of foolish people by doing what is right.</span>
<span class="verse 1Pet_2_16" data-osis="1Pet.2.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>Act as free people, yet not using your freedom as those do who make it a cloak for wickedness, but as Servants of God.</span>
<span class="verse 1Pet_2_17" data-osis="1Pet.2.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>Show honor to everyone, love the Lord's followers, ‘revere God, honor the emperor.’</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse 1Pet_2_18" data-osis="1Pet.2.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>Those of you who are domestic servants should always be submissive and respectful to their masters, not only to those who are good and considerate, but also to those who are arbitrary.</span>
<span class="verse 1Pet_2_19" data-osis="1Pet.2.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>For this wins God’s approval when, because conscious of God’s presence, a person who is suffering unjustly bears their troubles patiently.</span>
<span class="verse 1Pet_2_20" data-osis="1Pet.2.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>What credit can you claim when, after doing wrong, you take your punishment for it patiently? But, on the other hand, if, after doing right, you take your sufferings patiently, that does win the approval of God.</span>
<span class="verse 1Pet_2_21" data-osis="1Pet.2.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>For it was to this that you were called! For Christ, too, suffered — on your behalf — and left you an example, that you should follow in his steps.</span>
<span class="verse 1Pet_2_22" data-osis="1Pet.2.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>He ‘never sinned, nor was anything deceitful ever heard from his lips.’</span>
<span class="verse 1Pet_2_23" data-osis="1Pet.2.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>He was abused, but he did not answer with abuse; he suffered, but he did not threaten; he entrusted himself to him whose judgments are just.</span>
<span class="verse 1Pet_2_24" data-osis="1Pet.2.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span>And he ‘himself carried our sins’ in his own body to the cross, so that we might die to our sins, and live for righteousness. ‘His bruising was your healing.’</span>
<span class="verse 1Pet_2_25" data-osis="1Pet.2.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span>Once you were straying like sheep, but now you have returned to the shepherd and guardian of your souls.</span>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<span class="verse 1Pet_5_1" data-osis="1Pet.5.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>As for the older ones among you, who bear office in the church, I, their fellow officer, and a witness to the sufferings of the Christ, who will also share in the glory that is to be revealed —</span>
<span class="verse 1Pet_5_2" data-osis="1Pet.5.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>I beg you to be true shepherds of the flock of God among you, not because you are compelled, but of your own free will; not from a base love of gain, but with a ready spirit;</span>
<span class="verse 1Pet_5_3" data-osis="1Pet.5.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>not as lords of your charges, but as examples to your flock.</span>
<span class="verse 1Pet_5_4" data-osis="1Pet.5.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>Then, when the chief shepherd appears, you will win the crown of glory that never fades.</span>
<span class="verse 1Pet_5_5" data-osis="1Pet.5.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>Again, you younger ones should show deference to the older. And all of you should put on the badge of humility in mutual service, for ‘God is opposed to the proud, but gives his help to the humble.’</span>
<span class="verse 1Pet_5_6" data-osis="1Pet.5.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>Humble yourselves, therefore, under the mighty hand of God, so that he may exalt you in his good time,</span>
<span class="verse 1Pet_5_7" data-osis="1Pet.5.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>laying all your anxieties on him, for he makes you his care.</span>
<span class="verse 1Pet_5_8" data-osis="1Pet.5.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>Exercise self-control, be watchful. Your adversary, the devil, like a roaring lion, is prowling about, eager to devour you.</span>
<span class="verse 1Pet_5_9" data-osis="1Pet.5.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>Stand firm against him, strong in your faith; knowing, as you do, that the  sufferings which you are undergoing are being endured to the full by the Lord's followers throughout the world.</span>
<span class="verse 1Pet_5_10" data-osis="1Pet.5.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>God, from whom all help comes, and who called you, by your union with Christ, into his eternal glory, will, when you have suffered for a little while, himself perfect, establish, strengthen you.</span>
<span class="verse 1Pet_5_11" data-osis="1Pet.5.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>To him be ascribed dominion for ever. Amen.</span>
<span class="verse 1Pet_5_12" data-osis="1Pet.5.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>I have been writing to you briefly by the hand of Silas, our true-hearted friend (for so I regard him), to encourage you, and to bear my testimony that in what I have written is to be found the true love of God. On that take your stand.</span>
<span class="verse 1Pet_5_13" data-osis="1Pet.5.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>Your sister church in ‘Babylon’ sends you greeting, and so does Mark, who is as a son to me.</span>
<span class="verse 1Pet_5_14" data-osis="1Pet.5.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>Greet one another with the kiss of love.</span>

<h4>Advice on Daily Life</h4>
<span class="verse 1Thess_4_1" data-osis="1Thess.4.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>Further, friends, we beg and urge you in the name of our Lord Jesus to carry out more fully than ever — as indeed you are already doing — all that you have heard from us as to what your daily life must be, if it is to please God.</span>
<span class="verse 1Thess_4_2" data-osis="1Thess.4.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>For you have not forgotten the directions that we gave you on the authority of our Lord Jesus.</span>
<p>
<span class="verse 1Thess_4_3" data-osis="1Thess.4.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>For this is God’s purpose — that you should be pure; abstaining from all immorality;</span>
<span class="verse 1Thess_4_4" data-osis="1Thess.4.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>each of you learning to gain control over your own body, in a way that is holy and honorable,</span>
<span class="verse 1Thess_4_5" data-osis="1Thess.4.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>and not for the mere gratification of your passions, like the Gentiles who know nothing of God;</span>
<span class="verse 1Thess_4_6" data-osis="1Thess.4.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>none of you overreaching or taking advantage of their fellow follower of the Lord in such matters. ‘The Lord takes vengeance’ on all who do such things, as we have already warned you and solemnly declared.</span>
<span class="verse 1Thess_4_7" data-osis="1Thess.4.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>For God’s call to us does not permit of an impure life, but demands purity.</span>
<span class="verse 1Thess_4_8" data-osis="1Thess.4.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>Therefore the person who disregards this warning disregards, not people, but God who gives you his Holy Spirit.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse 1Thess_4_9" data-osis="1Thess.4.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>As to love for each other there is no need to write to you; for you have yourselves been taught by God to love one another;</span>
<span class="verse 1Thess_4_10" data-osis="1Thess.4.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>and indeed you do act in this spirit towards all his people throughout Macedonia.</span>
</p>
<p>Yet, friends, we beg you to do even more.
<span class="verse 1Thess_4_11" data-osis="1Thess.4.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>Make it your ambition to live quietly, and to attend to your own business, and to work with your hands, as we directed you;</span>
<span class="verse 1Thess_4_12" data-osis="1Thess.4.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>so that your conduct may win respect from those outside the church, and that you may not want for anything.</span>
</p>
<h4>The Dead in Christ at the coming of the Lord</h4>
<span class="verse 1Thess_4_13" data-osis="1Thess.4.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>We don't want you to be ignorant, friends, about those who have passed to their rest. We don't want you to grieve like other people who have no hope.</span>
<span class="verse 1Thess_4_14" data-osis="1Thess.4.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>For, as we believe that Jesus died and rose again, so also we believe that God will bring, with Jesus, those who through him have passed to their rest.</span>
<span class="verse 1Thess_4_15" data-osis="1Thess.4.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>This we tell you on the authority of the Lord — that those of us who are still living at the coming of the Lord will not anticipate those who have passed to their rest.</span>
<span class="verse 1Thess_4_16" data-osis="1Thess.4.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>For, with a loud summons, with the shout of an archangel, and with the trumpet-call of God, the Lord himself will come down from heaven.</span>
<span class="verse 1Thess_4_17" data-osis="1Thess.4.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>Then those who died in union with Christ will rise first; and afterwards we who are still living will be caught up in the clouds, with them, to meet the Lord in the air; and so we will be for ever with the Lord.</span>
<span class="verse 1Thess_4_18" data-osis="1Thess.4.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>Therefore, comfort one another with what I have told you.</span>

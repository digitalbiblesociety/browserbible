<span class="verse 1Thess_5_1" data-osis="1Thess.5.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>But as to the times and the moments, there is no need, friends, for anyone to write to you.</span>
<span class="verse 1Thess_5_2" data-osis="1Thess.5.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>You yourselves know well that the day of the Lord will come just as a thief comes in the night.</span>
<span class="verse 1Thess_5_3" data-osis="1Thess.5.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>When people are saying ‘All is quiet and safe,’ it is then that, like birth pains on a pregnant woman, ruin comes suddenly upon them, and there will be no escape!</span>
<span class="verse 1Thess_5_4" data-osis="1Thess.5.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>You, however, friends, are not in darkness, that the daylight should take you by surprise as if you were thieves.</span>
<span class="verse 1Thess_5_5" data-osis="1Thess.5.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>For you all are ‘sons of light’ and ‘sons of the day.’</span>
</p>
<p>We have nothing to do with night, or darkness.
<span class="verse 1Thess_5_6" data-osis="1Thess.5.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>Therefore let us not sleep as others do. No, let us be watchful and self-controlled.</span>
<span class="verse 1Thess_5_7" data-osis="1Thess.5.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>It is at night that people sleep, and at night that drunkards get drunk.</span>
<span class="verse 1Thess_5_8" data-osis="1Thess.5.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>But let us, who belong to the day, control ourselves, and put on faith and love as a breast plate, and the hope of salvation as a helmet.</span>
<span class="verse 1Thess_5_9" data-osis="1Thess.5.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>For God destined us, not for wrath, but to win salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ, who died for us,</span>
<span class="verse 1Thess_5_10" data-osis="1Thess.5.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>that, whether we are still watching or have fallen asleep, we may live with him.</span>
<span class="verse 1Thess_5_11" data-osis="1Thess.5.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>Therefore encourage one another, and try to build up one another’s characters, as indeed you are doing.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Thess.5.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>But as to the times and the moments, there is no need, Brothers, for any one to write to you.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Thess.5.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>You yourselves know well that the Day of the Lord will come just as a thief comes in the night.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Thess.5.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>When people are saying &lsquo;All is quiet and safe,&rsquo; it is then that, like birth-pains upon a woman with child, Ruin comes suddenly upon them, and there will be no escape!</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Thess.5.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>You, however, Brothers, are not in darkness, that the daylight should take you by surprise as if you were thieves.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Thess.5.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>For you all are &lsquo;Sons of Light&rsquo; and &lsquo;Sons of the Day.&rsquo; We have nothing to do with night, or darkness.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Thess.5.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>Therefore let us not sleep as others do. No, let us be watchful and self-controlled.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Thess.5.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>It is at night that men sleep, and at night that drunkards get drunk.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Thess.5.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>But let us, who belong to the Day, control ourselves, and put on faith and love as a breast plate, and the hope of Salvation as a helmet.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Thess.5.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>For God destined us, not for Wrath, but to win Salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ, who died for us,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Thess.5.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>that, whether we are still watching or have fallen asleep, we may live with him.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Thess.5.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>Therefore encourage one another, and try to build up one another&rsquo;s characters, as indeed you are doing.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Thess.5.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>We beg you, Brothers, to value those who toil among you, and are your leaders in the Lord&rsquo;s service, and give you counsel.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Thess.5.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>Hold them in the very greatest esteem and affection for the sake of their work. Live at peace with one another.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Thess.5.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>We entreat you also, Brothers &mdash; warn the disorderly, comfort the faint-hearted, give a helping hand to the weak, and be patient with every one.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Thess.5.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>Take care that none of you ever pays back wrong for wrong, but always follow the kindest course with one another and with every one.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Thess.5.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span>Always be joyful;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Thess.5.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span>never cease to pray;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Thess.5.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span>under all circumstances give thanks to God. For this is his will for you as made known in Christ Jesus.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Thess.5.19"><span class="verse-num">19&nbsp;</span>Do not quench the Spirit;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Thess.5.20"><span class="verse-num">20&nbsp;</span>do not make light of preaching.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Thess.5.21"><span class="verse-num">21&nbsp;</span>Bring everything to the test; cling to what is good;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Thess.5.22"><span class="verse-num">22&nbsp;</span>shun every form of evil.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Thess.5.23"><span class="verse-num">23&nbsp;</span>May God himself, the giver of peace, make you altogether holy; and may your spirits, souls, and bodies be kept altogether faultless until the Coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Thess.5.24"><span class="verse-num">24&nbsp;</span>He who calls you will not fail you; he will complete his work.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Thess.5.25"><span class="verse-num">25&nbsp;</span>Brothers, pray for us.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Thess.5.26"><span class="verse-num">26&nbsp;</span>Greet all the Brothers with a sacred kiss.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Thess.5.27"><span class="verse-num">27&nbsp;</span>I adjure you in the Lord&rsquo;s name to have this letter read to all the Brethren.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Thess.5.28"><span class="verse-num">28&nbsp;</span>May the blessing of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.</span>

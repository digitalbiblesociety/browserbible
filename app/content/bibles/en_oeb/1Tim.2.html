<h4>General Directions on Church Matters</h4>
<span class="verse 1Tim_2_1" data-osis="1Tim.2.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>First of all, then, I ask that petitions, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings should be offered for everyone,</span>
<span class="verse 1Tim_2_2" data-osis="1Tim.2.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>especially for kings and all who are in high positions, in order that we may lead a quiet and peaceful life in a deeply religious and reverent spirit.</span>
<span class="verse 1Tim_2_3" data-osis="1Tim.2.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>This will be good and acceptable in the eyes of God, our Savior,</span>
<span class="verse 1Tim_2_4" data-osis="1Tim.2.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>whose will is that everyone should be saved, and attain to a full knowledge of the truth.</span>
<span class="verse 1Tim_2_5" data-osis="1Tim.2.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>There is but one God, and one mediator between God and men — the man, Christ Jesus,</span>
<span class="verse 1Tim_2_6" data-osis="1Tim.2.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>who gave himself as a ransom on behalf of all men.</span>
<p>This must be our testimony, as opportunities present themselves;
<span class="verse 1Tim_2_7" data-osis="1Tim.2.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>and it was for this that I was myself appointed a herald and an apostle (I am telling the simple truth and no lie) — a teacher of the Gentiles in the faith and truth.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse 1Tim_2_8" data-osis="1Tim.2.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>My desire, then, is that it should be the custom everywhere for the men to lead the prayers, with hands reverently uplifted, avoiding heated controversy.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse 1Tim_2_9" data-osis="1Tim.2.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>I also desire that women should adorn themselves with appropriate dress, worn quietly and modestly, and not with wreaths or gold ornaments for the hair, or pearls, or costly clothing,</span>
<span class="verse 1Tim_2_10" data-osis="1Tim.2.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>but — as is proper for women who profess to be religious — with good actions.</span>
<span class="verse 1Tim_2_11" data-osis="1Tim.2.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>They must learn, listening quietly to their teachers and showing them all deference.</span>
<span class="verse 1Tim_2_12" data-osis="1Tim.2.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>I do not consent to them becoming teachers, or exercising authority over men; they ought to not make a fuss.</span>
<span class="verse 1Tim_2_13" data-osis="1Tim.2.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>Adam was formed first, not Eve.</span>
<span class="verse 1Tim_2_14" data-osis="1Tim.2.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>And it was not Adam who was deceived; it was the woman who was entirely deceived and fell into sin.</span>
<span class="verse 1Tim_2_15" data-osis="1Tim.2.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>But she will be saved by the birth of a child, if they never abandon faith, love, or holiness, and behave with modesty.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Tim.2.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>First of all, then, I urge that petitions, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings should be offered for every one,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Tim.2.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>especially for kings and all who are in high positions, in order that we may lead a quiet and peaceful life in a deeply religious and reverent spirit.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Tim.2.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>This will be good and acceptable in the eyes of God, our Saviour,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Tim.2.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>whose will is that every one should be saved, and attain to a full knowledge of the Truth.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Tim.2.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>There is but one God, and one mediator between God and men &mdash; the man, Christ Jesus,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Tim.2.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>who gave himself as a ransom on behalf of all men. This must be our testimony, as opportunities present themselves;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Tim.2.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>and it was for this that I was myself appointed a Herald and an Apostle (I am telling the simple truth and no lie) &mdash; a Teacher of the Gentiles in the Faith and Truth.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Tim.2.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>My desire, then, is that it should be the custom everywhere for the men to lead the prayers, with hands reverently uplifted, avoiding heated controversy.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Tim.2.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>I also desire that women should adorn themselves with appropriate dress, worn quietly and modestly, and not with wreaths or gold ornaments for the hair, or pearls, or costly clothing,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Tim.2.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>but &mdash; as is proper for women who profess to be religious &mdash; with good actions.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Tim.2.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>A woman should listen silently to her teachers, and show them all deference.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Tim.2.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>I do not consent to a woman&rsquo;s becoming a teacher, or exercising authority over a man; she ought to be silent.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Tim.2.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>Adam was formed first, not Eve.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Tim.2.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>And it was not Adam who was deceived; it was the woman who was entirely deceived and fell into sin.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Tim.2.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>But women will find their salvation in motherhood, if they never abandon faith, love, or holiness, and behave with modesty.</span>

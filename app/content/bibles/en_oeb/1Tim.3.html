<span class="verse 1Tim_3_1" data-osis="1Tim.3.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>How true is that saying! When a man aspires to be a Presiding-Officer in the Church, he is ambitious for a noble task.</span>
<span class="verse 1Tim_3_2" data-osis="1Tim.3.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>The Presiding-Officer should be a man of blameless character; a faithful husband; living a temperate, discreet, and well-ordered life; hospitable, and a skilful teacher,</span>
<span class="verse 1Tim_3_3" data-osis="1Tim.3.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>not addicted to drink or brawling, but of a forbearing and peaceable disposition, and not a lover of money;</span>
<span class="verse 1Tim_3_4" data-osis="1Tim.3.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>he should be a man who rules his own household well, and whose children are kept under control and are well-behaved.</span>
<span class="verse 1Tim_3_5" data-osis="1Tim.3.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>If a man does not know how to rule his own household, how can he take charge of the Church of God?</span>
<span class="verse 1Tim_3_6" data-osis="1Tim.3.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>The Presiding-Officer should not be a recent convert, that he may not be blinded by pride and fall under the same condemnation as the Devil.</span>
<span class="verse 1Tim_3_7" data-osis="1Tim.3.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>He should also be well spoken of by outsiders, that he may not incur censure and so fall into the snares of the Devil.</span>
<span class="verse 1Tim_3_8" data-osis="1Tim.3.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>So, too, Assistant-Officers should be serious and straightforward men, not given to taking much drink or to questionable money-making,</span>
<span class="verse 1Tim_3_9" data-osis="1Tim.3.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>but men who hold the deep truths of the Faith and have a clear conscience.</span>
<span class="verse 1Tim_3_10" data-osis="1Tim.3.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>They should be tested first, and only appointed to their Office if no objection is raised against them.</span>
<span class="verse 1Tim_3_11" data-osis="1Tim.3.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>It should be the same with the women. They should be serious, not gossips, sober, and trustworthy in all respects.</span>
<span class="verse 1Tim_3_12" data-osis="1Tim.3.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>Assistant-Officers should be faithful husbands, and men who rule their children and their households well.</span>
<span class="verse 1Tim_3_13" data-osis="1Tim.3.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>Those who have filled that post with honour gain for themselves an honourable position, as well as great confidence through the faith that they place in Christ Jesus.</span>
<span class="verse 1Tim_3_14" data-osis="1Tim.3.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>I am writing this to you, though I hope that I shall come to see you before long;</span>
<span class="verse 1Tim_3_15" data-osis="1Tim.3.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>but in case I should be delayed, I want you to know what your conduct ought to be in the Household of God, which is the Church of the Living God &mdash; the pillar and stay of the Truth.</span>
<span class="verse 1Tim_3_16" data-osis="1Tim.3.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>Yes, and confessedly wonderful are the deep truths of our religion; for &mdash;  &lsquo;He was revealed in our nature, pronounced righteous in spirit, seen by angels, proclaimed among the Gentiles, believed on in the world, taken up into glory.&rsquo;</span>

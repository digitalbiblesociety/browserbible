<span class="verse" data-osis="1Tim.4.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>But the Spirit distinctly says that in later times there will be some who will fall away from the Faith, and devote their attention to misleading spirits, and to the teaching of demons,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Tim.4.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>who will make use of the hypocrisy of lying teachers. These men&rsquo;s consciences are seared,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Tim.4.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>and they discourage marriage and enjoin abstinence from certain kinds of food; though God created these foods to be enjoyed thankfully by those who hold the Faith and have attained a full knowledge of the Truth.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Tim.4.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>Everything created by God is good, and there in nothing that need be rejected &mdash; provided only that it is received thankfully;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Tim.4.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>for it is consecrated by God&rsquo;s blessing and by prayer.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Tim.4.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>Put all this before the Brethren, and you will be a good servant of Christ Jesus, sustained by the precepts of the Faith and of that Good Teaching by which you have guided your life.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Tim.4.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>As for profane legends and old wives&rsquo; tales, leave them alone. Train yourself to lead a religious life;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Tim.4.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>for while the training of the body is of service in some respects, religion is of service in all, carrying with it, as it does, a promise of Life both here and hereafter.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Tim.4.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>How true that saying is and worthy of the fullest acceptance!</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Tim.4.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>With that aim we toil and struggle, for we have set our hopes on the Living God, who is the Saviour of all men, and especially of those who hold the Faith.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Tim.4.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>Dwell upon these things in your teaching.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Tim.4.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>Do not let any one look down on you because you are young, but, by your conversation, your conduct, your love, your faith, and your purity, be an example to those who hold the Faith.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Tim.4.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>Till I come, apply yourself to public reading, preaching, and teaching.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Tim.4.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>Do not neglect the divine gift within you, which was given you, amid many a prediction, when the hands of the Officers of the Church were laid on your head.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Tim.4.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>Practice these things, devote yourself to them, so that your progress may be plain to every one.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Tim.4.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span>Look to yourself as well as to your teaching. Persevere in this, for your doing so will mean Salvation for yourself as well as for your hearers.</span>

<h2 class="chapter-num">4</h2>
<p>
<span class="verse 1Tim_4_1" data-osis="1Tim.4.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>But the Spirit distinctly says that in later times there will be some who will fall away from the faith, and devote their attention to misleading spirits, and to the teaching of demons,</span>
<span class="verse 1Tim_4_2" data-osis="1Tim.4.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>who will make use of the hypocrisy of lying teachers. These people’s consciences are seared,</span>
<span class="verse 1Tim_4_3" data-osis="1Tim.4.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>and they discourage marriage and enjoin abstinence from certain kinds of food; though God created these foods to be enjoyed thankfully by those who hold the faith and have attained a full knowledge of the truth.</span>
<span class="verse 1Tim_4_4" data-osis="1Tim.4.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>Everything created by God is good, and there in nothing that need be rejected — provided only that it is received thankfully;</span>
<span class="verse 1Tim_4_5" data-osis="1Tim.4.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>for it is consecrated by God’s blessing and by prayer.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse 1Tim_4_6" data-osis="1Tim.4.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>Put all this before the followers, and you will be a good servant of Christ Jesus, sustained by the precepts of the faith and of that good teaching by which you have guided your life.</span>
<span class="verse 1Tim_4_7" data-osis="1Tim.4.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>As for profane legends and old wives’ tales, leave them alone. Train yourself to lead a religious life;</span>
<span class="verse 1Tim_4_8" data-osis="1Tim.4.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>for while the training of the body is of service in some respects, religion is of service in all, carrying with it, as it does, a promise of life both here and hereafter.</span>
<span class="verse 1Tim_4_9" data-osis="1Tim.4.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>How true that saying is and worthy of the fullest acceptance!</span>
<span class="verse 1Tim_4_10" data-osis="1Tim.4.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>With that aim we toil and struggle, for we have set our hopes on the living God, who is the Savior of all, and especially of those who hold the faith.</span>
<span class="verse 1Tim_4_11" data-osis="1Tim.4.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>Remember these things in your teaching.</span>
<span class="verse 1Tim_4_12" data-osis="1Tim.4.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>Do not let anyone look down on you because you are young, but, by your conversation, your conduct, your love, your faith, and your purity, be an example to those who hold the faith.</span>
<span class="verse 1Tim_4_13" data-osis="1Tim.4.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>Until I come, apply yourself to public reading, preaching, and teaching.</span>
<span class="verse 1Tim_4_14" data-osis="1Tim.4.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>Do not neglect the divine gift within you, which was given you, amid many a prediction, when the hands of the officers of the church were laid on your head.</span>
<span class="verse 1Tim_4_15" data-osis="1Tim.4.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>Practice these things, devote yourself to them, so that your progress may be plain to everyone.</span>
<span class="verse 1Tim_4_16" data-osis="1Tim.4.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>Look to yourself as well as to your teaching. Persevere in this, for your doing so will mean salvation for yourself as well as for your hearers.</span>

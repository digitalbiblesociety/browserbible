<h2 class="chapter-num">12</h2>
<p>
<span class="verse 2Cor_12_1" data-osis="2Cor.12.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>I must boast! It is unprofitable; but I will pass to visions and revelations given by the Lord.</span>
<span class="verse 2Cor_12_2" data-osis="2Cor.12.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>I know a man in union with Christ, who, fourteen years ago —  whether in the body or out of the body I do not know; God knows —  was caught up (this man of whom I am speaking) to the third heaven.</span>
<span class="verse 2Cor_12_3" data-osis="2Cor.12.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>And I know that this man — whether in the body or separated from the body I do not know; God knows —</span>
<span class="verse 2Cor_12_4" data-osis="2Cor.12.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>Was caught up into Paradise, and heard unspeakable things of which no human being may tell.</span>
<span class="verse 2Cor_12_5" data-osis="2Cor.12.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>About such a man I will boast, but about myself I will not boast except as regards my weaknesses.</span>
<span class="verse 2Cor_12_6" data-osis="2Cor.12.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>Yet if I choose to boast, I will not be a fool; for I will be speaking no more than the truth. But I refrain, in case anyone should credit me with more than he can see in me or hear from me, and because of the marvelous character of the revelations.</span>
<span class="verse 2Cor_12_7" data-osis="2Cor.12.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>It was for this reason, and to prevent my thinking too highly of myself, that a thorn was sent to pierce my flesh — an instrument of Satan to discipline me — so that I should not think too highly of myself.</span>
<span class="verse 2Cor_12_8" data-osis="2Cor.12.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>About this I three times entreated the Lord, praying that it might leave me.</span>
<span class="verse 2Cor_12_9" data-osis="2Cor.12.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>But his reply has been — <span class="woc">‘My help is enough for you; for my strength attains its perfection in the midst of weakness.’</span></span>
</p>
<p>Most gladly, then, will I boast all the more of my weaknesses, so that the strength of the Christ may overshadow me.
<span class="verse 2Cor_12_10" data-osis="2Cor.12.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>That is why I delight in weakness, ill treatment, hardship, persecution, and difficulties, when borne for Christ. For, when I am weak, then it is that I am strong!</span>
</p>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<span class="verse 2Cor_12_11" data-osis="2Cor.12.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>I have been “playing the fool!” It is you who drove me to it. For it is you who ought to have been commending me! Although I am nobody, in no respect did I prove inferior to the most eminent apostles.</span>
<span class="verse 2Cor_12_12" data-osis="2Cor.12.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>The marks of the true apostle were exhibited among you in constant endurance, as well as by signs, by marvels, and by miracles.</span>
<span class="verse 2Cor_12_13" data-osis="2Cor.12.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>In what respect, I ask, were you treated worse than the other churches, unless it was that, for my part, I refused to become a burden to you? Forgive me the wrong I did to you!</span>
<p>
<span class="verse 2Cor_12_14" data-osis="2Cor.12.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>Remember, this is the third time that I have made every preparation to come to see you, and I will refuse to be a burden to you; I want, not your money, but you. It is not the duty of children to put by for their parents, but of parents to put by for their children.</span>
<span class="verse 2Cor_12_15" data-osis="2Cor.12.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>For my part, I will most gladly spend, and be spent, for your welfare. Can it be that the more intensely I love you the less I am to be loved?</span>
<span class="verse 2Cor_12_16" data-osis="2Cor.12.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>You will admit that I was not a burden to you but you say that I was “crafty” and caught you “by a trick”!</span>
<span class="verse 2Cor_12_17" data-osis="2Cor.12.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>Do you assert that I took advantage of you through any of those whom I have sent to you?</span>
<span class="verse 2Cor_12_18" data-osis="2Cor.12.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>I urged Titus to go, and I sent another follower with him. Did Titus take any advantage of you? Did not we live in the same Spirit, and tread in the same footsteps?</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse 2Cor_12_19" data-osis="2Cor.12.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>Have you all this time been fancying that it is to you that we are making our defense? No, it is in the sight of God, and in union with Christ, that we are speaking. And all this, dear friends, is to build up your characters;</span>
<span class="verse 2Cor_12_20" data-osis="2Cor.12.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>for I am afraid that perhaps, when I come, I may find that you are not what I want you to be, and, on the other hand, that you may find that I am what you do not want me to be. I am afraid that I may find quarreling, jealousy, ill feeling, rivalry, slandering, backbiting, self-assertion, and disorder.</span>
<span class="verse 2Cor_12_21" data-osis="2Cor.12.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>I am afraid that, on my next visit, my God may humble me in regard to you, and that I may have to mourn over many who have long been sinning, and have not repented of the impurity, immorality, and sensuality, in which they have indulged.</span>

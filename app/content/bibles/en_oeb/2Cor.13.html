<span class="verse" data-osis="2Cor.13.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>For the third time I am coming to see you. &lsquo;By the word of two or three witnesses each statement shall be established.&rsquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Cor.13.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>I have said it, and I say it again before I come, just as if I were with you on my second visit, though for the moment absent, I say to those who have been long sinning, as well as to all others &mdash; that if I come again, I shall spare no one.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Cor.13.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>And that will be the proof, which you are looking for, that the Christ speaks through me. There is no weakness in his dealings with you. No, he shows his power among you.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Cor.13.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>For though his crucifixion was due to weakness, his life is due to the power of God. And we, also, are weak in his weakness, but with him we shall live for you through the power of God.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Cor.13.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>Put yourselves to the proof, to see whether you are holding to the Faith. Test yourselves. Surely you recognise this fact about yourselves &mdash; that Jesus Christ is in you! Unless indeed you cannot stand the test!</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Cor.13.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>But I hope that you will recognise that we can stand the test.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Cor.13.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>We pray God that you may do nothing wrong, not that we may be seen to stand the test, but that you may do what is right, even though we may seem not to stand the test.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Cor.13.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>We have no power at all against the Truth, but we have power in the service of the Truth.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Cor.13.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>We are glad when we are weak, if you are strong. And what we pray for is that you may become perfect.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Cor.13.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>This is my reason for writing as I am now doing, while I am away from you, so that, when I am with you, I may not act harshly in the exercise of the authority which the Lord gave me &mdash; and gave me for building up and not for pulling down.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Cor.13.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>And now, brothers, good-bye. Aim at perfection; take courage; agree together; live in peace. And then God, the source of all love and peace, will be with you.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Cor.13.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>Greet one another with a sacred kiss.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Cor.13.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>All Christ&rsquo;s people here send you their greetings.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Cor.13.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>May the blessing of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion with the Holy Spirit, be with you all.</span>

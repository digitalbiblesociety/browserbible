<span class="verse 2Cor_3_1" data-osis="2Cor.3.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>Are we beginning to commend ourselves again? Or are we like some who need letters of commendation to you, or from you?</span>
<span class="verse 2Cor_3_2" data-osis="2Cor.3.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>You yourselves are our letter — a letter written on our hearts, and one which everybody can read and understand.</span>
<span class="verse 2Cor_3_3" data-osis="2Cor.3.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>All can see that you are a letter from Christ delivered by us, a letter written, not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God, not on ‘tablets of stone,’ but on ‘tablets of human hearts.’</span>

<h4>The Ministry of the Apostles</h4>
<span class="verse 2Cor_3_4" data-osis="2Cor.3.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>This, then, is the confidence in regard to God that we have gained through the Christ.</span>
<span class="verse 2Cor_3_5" data-osis="2Cor.3.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>I do not mean that we are fit to form any judgment by ourselves, as if on our own authority;</span>
<span class="verse 2Cor_3_6" data-osis="2Cor.3.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>our fitness comes from God, who himself made us fit to be ministers of a new covenant, of which the substance is, not a written law, but a Spirit. For the written law means death, but the Spirit gives life.</span>
<p>
<span class="verse 2Cor_3_7" data-osis="2Cor.3.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>If the system of religion which involved death, embodied in a written law and engraved on stones, began amid such glory, that the Israelites were unable to gaze at the face of Moses because of its glory, though it was but a passing glory,</span>
<span class="verse 2Cor_3_8" data-osis="2Cor.3.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>will not the religion that confers the Spirit have still greater glory?</span>
<span class="verse 2Cor_3_9" data-osis="2Cor.3.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>For, if there was a glory in the religion that involved condemnation, far greater is the glory of the religion that confers righteousness!</span>
<span class="verse 2Cor_3_10" data-osis="2Cor.3.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>Indeed, that which then had glory has lost its glory, because of the glory which surpasses it.</span>
<span class="verse 2Cor_3_11" data-osis="2Cor.3.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>And, if that which was to pass away was attended with glory, far more will that which is to endure be surrounded with glory!</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse 2Cor_3_12" data-osis="2Cor.3.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>With such a hope as this, we speak with all plainness;</span>
<span class="verse 2Cor_3_13" data-osis="2Cor.3.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>unlike Moses, who covered his face with a veil, to prevent the Israelites from gazing at the disappearance of what was passing away.</span>
<span class="verse 2Cor_3_14" data-osis="2Cor.3.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>But their minds were slow to learn. Indeed, to this very day, at the public reading of the old covenant, the same veil remains ; only for those who are in union with Christ does it pass away.</span>
<span class="verse 2Cor_3_15" data-osis="2Cor.3.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>But, even to this day, whenever Moses is read, a veil lies on their hearts.</span>
<span class="verse 2Cor_3_16" data-osis="2Cor.3.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>‘Yet, whenever someone turns to the Lord, the veil is removed.’</span>
<span class="verse 2Cor_3_17" data-osis="2Cor.3.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>And the ‘Lord’ is the Spirit, and, where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.</span>
<span class="verse 2Cor_3_18" data-osis="2Cor.3.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>And all of us, with faces from which the veil is lifted, seeing, as if reflected in a mirror, the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into his likeness, from glory to glory, as it is given by the Lord, the Spirit.</span>

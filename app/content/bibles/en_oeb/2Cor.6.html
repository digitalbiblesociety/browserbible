<span class="verse" data-osis="2Cor.6.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>Therefore, as God&rsquo;s fellow-workers, we also appeal to you not to receive his loving-kindness in vain.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Cor.6.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>For he says &mdash; &lsquo;At the time for acceptance I listened to thee, And on the day of deliverance I helped thee.&rsquo; Now is the time for acceptance! Now is the day of deliverance!</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Cor.6.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>Never do we put an obstacle in any one&rsquo;s way, that no fault may be found with our ministry.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Cor.6.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>No, we are trying to commend ourselves under all circumstances, as God&rsquo;s ministers should &mdash; in many an hour of endurance, in troubles, in hardships, in difficulties,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Cor.6.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>in floggings, in imprisonments, in riots, in toils, in sleepless nights, in fastings;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Cor.6.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>by purity, by knowledge, by patience, by kindliness, by holiness of spirit, by unfeigned love;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Cor.6.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>by the Message of Truth, and by the power of God; by the weapons of righteousness in the right hand and in the left;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Cor.6.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>amid honour and disrepute, amid slander and praise; regarded as deceivers, yet proved to be true;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Cor.6.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>as unknown, yet well-known; as at death&rsquo;s door, yet, see, we are living; as chastised, yet not killed;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Cor.6.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>as saddened, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet enriching many; as having nothing, and yet possessing all things!</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Cor.6.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>We have been speaking freely to you, men of Corinth; we have opened our heart;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Cor.6.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>there is room there for you, yet there is not room, in your love, for us.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Cor.6.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>Can you not in return &mdash; I appeal to you as I should to children &mdash; open your hearts to us?</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Cor.6.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>Do not enter into inconsistent relations with those who reject the Faith. For what partnership can there be between righteousness and lawlessness? or what has light to do with darkness?</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Cor.6.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>What harmony can there be between Christ and Belial? or what can those who accept the Faith have in common with those who reject it?</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Cor.6.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span>What agreement can thee be between a temple of God and idols? And we are a temple of the Living God. That is what God meant when he said &mdash; &lsquo;I will dwell among them, and walk among them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Cor.6.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span>Therefore &ldquo;Come out from among the nations, and separate yourselves from them,&rdquo; says the Lord, &ldquo;and touch nothing impure; And I will welcome you;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Cor.6.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span>and I will be a father to you, and you shall be my sons and daughters,&rdquo; says the Lord, the Ruler of all.&rsquo;</span>

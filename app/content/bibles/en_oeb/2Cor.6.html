<h2 class="chapter-num">6</h2>
<p>
<span class="verse 2Cor_6_1" data-osis="2Cor.6.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>Therefore, as God’s fellow workers, we also appeal to you not to receive his loving kindness in vain.</span>
<span class="verse 2Cor_6_2" data-osis="2Cor.6.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>For he says —<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘At the time for acceptance I listened to you,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And on the day of deliverance I helped you.’<br /><br />Now is the time for acceptance! Now is the day of deliverance!</span>
<span class="verse 2Cor_6_3" data-osis="2Cor.6.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>Never do we put an obstacle in anyone’s way, so that no fault may be found with our ministry.</span>
<span class="verse 2Cor_6_4" data-osis="2Cor.6.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>No, we are trying to commend ourselves under all circumstances, as God’s ministers should — in many an hour of endurance, in troubles, in hardships, in difficulties,</span>
<span class="verse 2Cor_6_5" data-osis="2Cor.6.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>in floggings, in imprisonments, in riots, in toils, in sleepless nights, in fastings;</span>
<span class="verse 2Cor_6_6" data-osis="2Cor.6.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>by purity, by knowledge, by patience, by kindliness, by holiness of spirit, by unfeigned love;</span>
<span class="verse 2Cor_6_7" data-osis="2Cor.6.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>by the message of truth, and by the power of God; by the weapons of righteousness in the right hand and in the left;</span>
<span class="verse 2Cor_6_8" data-osis="2Cor.6.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>amid honor and disrepute, amid slander and praise; regarded as deceivers, yet proved to be true;</span>
<span class="verse 2Cor_6_9" data-osis="2Cor.6.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>as unknown, yet well-known; as at death’s door, yet, see, we are living; as chastised, yet not killed;</span>
<span class="verse 2Cor_6_10" data-osis="2Cor.6.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>as saddened, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet enriching many; as having nothing, and yet possessing all things!</span>
</p>
<h4>The Apostle and his Converts</h4>
<span class="verse 2Cor_6_11" data-osis="2Cor.6.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>We have been speaking freely to you, dear friends in Corinth; we have opened our heart;</span>
<span class="verse 2Cor_6_12" data-osis="2Cor.6.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>there is room there for you, yet there is not room, in your love, for us.</span>
<span class="verse 2Cor_6_13" data-osis="2Cor.6.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>Can you not in return — I appeal to you as I should to children — open your hearts to us?</span>
<p>
<span class="verse 2Cor_6_14" data-osis="2Cor.6.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>Do not enter into inconsistent relations with those who reject the faith. For what partnership can there be between righteousness and lawlessness? Or what has light to do with darkness?</span>
<span class="verse 2Cor_6_15" data-osis="2Cor.6.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>What harmony can there be between Christ and Belial? Or what can those who accept the faith have in common with those who reject it?</span>
<span class="verse 2Cor_6_16" data-osis="2Cor.6.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>What agreement can you be between a temple of God and idols? And we are a temple of the living God. That is what God meant when he said —<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘I will live among them, and walk among them;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I will be their God, and they will be my people.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
<span class="verse 2Cor_6_17" data-osis="2Cor.6.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>Therefore “Come out from among the nations, and separate yourselves from them,” says the Lord,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“And touch nothing impure;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I will welcome you;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
<span class="verse 2Cor_6_18" data-osis="2Cor.6.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>and I will be a father to you, and you will be my sons and daughters,”<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;says the Lord, the Ruler of all.’<br /><br /></span>

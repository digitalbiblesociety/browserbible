<h2 class="chapter-num">7</h2>
<p>
<span class="verse 2Cor_7_1" data-osis="2Cor.7.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>With these promises, dear friends, let us purify ourselves from everything that pollutes either body or spirit, and, in deepest respect for God, aim at perfect holiness.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse 2Cor_7_2" data-osis="2Cor.7.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>Make room for us in your hearts. In no instance have we ever wronged, or harmed, or taken advantage of, anyone.</span>
<span class="verse 2Cor_7_3" data-osis="2Cor.7.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>I am not saying this to condemn you. Indeed, I have already said that you are in our  heart, to live and die together.</span>
<span class="verse 2Cor_7_4" data-osis="2Cor.7.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>I have the utmost confidence in you; I am always boasting about you. I am full of encouragement and, in spite of all our troubles, my heart is overflowing with happiness.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse 2Cor_7_5" data-osis="2Cor.7.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>Ever since we reached Macedonia, we have had no rest in body or mind; on every side there have been troubles — conflicts without, anxieties within.</span>
<span class="verse 2Cor_7_6" data-osis="2Cor.7.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>But God, who encourages the downcast, has encouraged us by the arrival of Titus.</span>
<span class="verse 2Cor_7_7" data-osis="2Cor.7.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>And it is not only by his arrival that we are encouraged, but also by the encouragement which he received from you; for he tells us of your strong affection, your penitence, and your zeal on my behalf — so that I am happier still.</span>
<span class="verse 2Cor_7_8" data-osis="2Cor.7.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>For, though I caused you sorrow by my letter, I do not regret it. Even if I were inclined to regret it — for I see that my letter did cause you sorrow though only for a time —</span>
<span class="verse 2Cor_7_9" data-osis="2Cor.7.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>I am glad now; not because of the sorrow it caused you, but because your sorrow brought you to repentance. For it was God’s will that you should feel sorrow, in order that you should not suffer loss in any way at our hands.</span>
<span class="verse 2Cor_7_10" data-osis="2Cor.7.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>For, when sorrow is in accordance with God’s will, it results in a repentance leading to salvation, and which will never be regretted. The sure result of the sorrow that the world knows is death.</span>
<span class="verse 2Cor_7_11" data-osis="2Cor.7.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>For see what results that other sorrow — sorrow in accordance with God’s will — has had in your case. What earnestness it produced! What explanations! What strong feeling! What alarm! What longing! What eagerness! What readiness to punish! You have proved yourselves altogether free from guilt in that matter.</span>
<span class="verse 2Cor_7_12" data-osis="2Cor.7.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>So, then, even though I did write to you, it was not for the sake of the wrong-doer, or of the man who was wronged, but to make you conscious, in the sight of God, of your own earnest care for us. And it is this that has encouraged us.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse 2Cor_7_13" data-osis="2Cor.7.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>In addition to the encouragement that this gave us, we were made far happier still by the happiness of Titus for his heart has been cheered by you all.</span>
<span class="verse 2Cor_7_14" data-osis="2Cor.7.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>Although I have been boasting a little to him about you, you did not put me to shame; but, just as every thing we had said to you was true, so our boasting to Titus about you has also proved to be the truth.</span>
<span class="verse 2Cor_7_15" data-osis="2Cor.7.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>And his affection for you is all the greater, as he remembers the deference that you all showed him, and recalls how you received him with anxious care.</span>
<span class="verse 2Cor_7_16" data-osis="2Cor.7.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>I am glad that I can feel perfect confidence in you.</span>

<h4>The Palestine Famine Fund</h4>
<span class="verse 2Cor_8_1" data-osis="2Cor.8.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>We want to remind you, friends, of the love that God has shown to the churches in Macedonia —</span>
<span class="verse 2Cor_8_2" data-osis="2Cor.8.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>How, tired though they were by many a trouble, their overflowing happiness, and even their deep poverty, resulted in a flood of generosity.</span>
<span class="verse 2Cor_8_3" data-osis="2Cor.8.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>I can bear witness that to the full extent of their power, and even beyond their power, spontaneously,</span>
<span class="verse 2Cor_8_4" data-osis="2Cor.8.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>and with many an appeal to us for permission, they showed their love, and contributed their share towards the fund for their fellow Christians.</span>
<span class="verse 2Cor_8_5" data-osis="2Cor.8.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>And that, not only in the way we had expected; but first they gave themselves to the Lord, and to us also, in accordance with God’s will.</span>
<span class="verse 2Cor_8_6" data-osis="2Cor.8.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>And this led us beg Titus, since he had started the work for you, he should also see to the completion of this expression of your love.</span>
<span class="verse 2Cor_8_7" data-osis="2Cor.8.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>And, remembering how you excel in everything — in faith, in teaching, in knowledge, in unfailing earnestness, and in the affection that we have awakened in you — I ask you to excel also in this expression of your love.</span>
<p>
<span class="verse 2Cor_8_8" data-osis="2Cor.8.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>I am not laying a command on you, but I am making use of the earnestness shown by others to test the genuineness of your affection.</span>
<span class="verse 2Cor_8_9" data-osis="2Cor.8.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>For you do not forget the loving kindness of our Lord Jesus Christ — how that for your sakes, although he was rich, he became poor, so that you also might become rich through his poverty.</span>
<span class="verse 2Cor_8_10" data-osis="2Cor.8.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>I am only making suggestions on this matter; for this is the best course for you, since you were a year before others, not only in taking action, but also in showing your readiness to do so.</span>
<span class="verse 2Cor_8_11" data-osis="2Cor.8.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>And now I want you to complete the work, so that its completion may correspond with your willing readiness — in proportion, of course, to your means.</span>
<span class="verse 2Cor_8_12" data-osis="2Cor.8.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>For, where there is willingness, a person’s gift is valued by its comparison with what they have, and not with what they do not have.</span>
<span class="verse 2Cor_8_13" data-osis="2Cor.8.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>For our object is not to give relief to others and bring distress on you. It is a matter of a fair balance.</span>
<span class="verse 2Cor_8_14" data-osis="2Cor.8.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>On this occasion what you can spare will supply what they need, at another time what they can spare may supply your need, and so things will be equal.</span>
<span class="verse 2Cor_8_15" data-osis="2Cor.8.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>As scripture says —<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘Those who had much had nothing over, and those who had little did not lack!’<br /><br /></span>
<span class="verse 2Cor_8_16" data-osis="2Cor.8.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>I thank God for inspiring Titus with the same keen interest in your welfare that I have;</span>
<span class="verse 2Cor_8_17" data-osis="2Cor.8.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>for Titus has responded to my appeals and, in his great earnestness, is starting to go to you of his own accord.</span>
<span class="verse 2Cor_8_18" data-osis="2Cor.8.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>We are sending with him one of the Lord's followers whose fame in the service of the good news has spread through all the churches;</span>
<span class="verse 2Cor_8_19" data-osis="2Cor.8.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>and not only that, but he has been elected by the churches to accompany us on our journey, in connexion with this expression of your love, which we are personally administering to the honor of the Lord, and to show our deep interest.</span>
<span class="verse 2Cor_8_20" data-osis="2Cor.8.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>What we are specially guarding against is that any fault should be found with us in regard to our administration of this charitable fund;</span>
<span class="verse 2Cor_8_21" data-osis="2Cor.8.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>for we are trying to make arrangements which will be right, not only in the eyes of the Lord, but also in the eyes of people.</span>
<span class="verse 2Cor_8_22" data-osis="2Cor.8.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>We are also sending with them another of our friends, whose earnestness we have many a time proved in many ways, and whom we now find made even more earnest by his great confidence in you.</span>
<span class="verse 2Cor_8_23" data-osis="2Cor.8.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>If I must say anything about Titus, he is my intimate companion, and he shares my work for you; if it is our friends, they are delegates of the churches, an honor to Christ.</span>
<span class="verse 2Cor_8_24" data-osis="2Cor.8.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span>Show them, therefore — so that the churches may see it —  the proof of your affection, and the ground for our boasting to them about you.</span>

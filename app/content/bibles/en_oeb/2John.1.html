<span class="verse 2John_1_1" data-osis="2John.1.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>To an eminent Christian Lady, and to her children, from the officer of the church. I sincerely love you all, and not I only, but also all those who have learned to know the truth.</span>
<span class="verse 2John_1_2" data-osis="2John.1.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>We love you for the sake of that truth which is always in our hearts; yes, and it will be ours for ever.</span>
<span class="verse 2John_1_3" data-osis="2John.1.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>Blessing, mercy, and peace will be ours — the gift of God, the Father, and of Jesus Christ, the Father’s Son — in a life of truth and love.</span>
<span class="verse 2John_1_4" data-osis="2John.1.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>It was a great joy to me to find the lives of some of your children guided by the truth, in obedience to the command that we received from the Father.</span>
<span class="verse 2John_1_5" data-osis="2John.1.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>And now, I pray you, Lady — not as though I were writing a new command for you; no, it is the command which we had from the first — Let us love one another.</span>
<span class="verse 2John_1_6" data-osis="2John.1.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>And this is love — to live in obedience to the Father’s commands. This is the command as you learned from the first, to live in a spirit of love.</span>
<span class="verse 2John_1_7" data-osis="2John.1.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>I say this because many impostors have left us to go into the world — people who do not acknowledge Jesus as Christ come in our human nature. It is that which marks someone as an impostor and an antichrist.</span>
<span class="verse 2John_1_8" data-osis="2John.1.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>Take care that you do not lose the fruit of all our work; rather, reap the benefit of it in full.</span>
<span class="verse 2John_1_9" data-osis="2John.1.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>Everyone who goes beyond the limits of the teaching of the Christ has failed to find God; the person who keeps to that teaching — they have found both the Father and the Son.</span>
<span class="verse 2John_1_10" data-osis="2John.1.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not receive them into your house or welcome them;</span>
<span class="verse 2John_1_11" data-osis="2John.1.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>for the person who welcomes them is sharing with them in his wicked work.</span>
<span class="verse 2John_1_12" data-osis="2John.1.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>Though I have a great deal to say to you, I would rather not trust it to paper and ink, but I am hoping to come and see you, and to speak with you face to face, so that your joy may be complete.</span>
<span class="verse 2John_1_13" data-osis="2John.1.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>The children of your eminent sister send you their greetings.</span>

<span class="verse 2Pet_3_1" data-osis="2Pet.3.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>This, dear friends, is my second letter to you. In both of them I have tried, by appealing to your remembrance, to arouse your better feelings.</span>
<span class="verse 2Pet_3_2" data-osis="2Pet.3.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>I want you to recall what was foretold by the holy Prophets, as well as the Command of our Lord and Saviour given to you through your Apostles.</span>
<span class="verse 2Pet_3_3" data-osis="2Pet.3.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>First be assured of this, that, as the age draws to an end, scoffers, led by their own passions,</span>
<span class="verse 2Pet_3_4" data-osis="2Pet.3.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>will come and ask scoffingly &mdash;  &lsquo;Where is his promised Coming? Ever since our fathers passed to their rest, everything remains just as it was when the world was first created!&rsquo;</span>
<span class="verse 2Pet_3_5" data-osis="2Pet.3.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>For they wilfully shut their eyes to the fact that long ago the heavens existed; and the earth, also &mdash; formed out of water and by the action of water, by the fiat of God;</span>
<span class="verse 2Pet_3_6" data-osis="2Pet.3.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>and that by the same means the world which then existed was destroyed in a deluge of water.</span>
<span class="verse 2Pet_3_7" data-osis="2Pet.3.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>But the present heavens and earth, by the same fiat, have been reserved for fire, and are being kept for the day of the judgment and destruction of the godless.</span>
<span class="verse 2Pet_3_8" data-osis="2Pet.3.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>But you, dear friends, must never shut your eyes to the fact that, to the Lord, one day is the same as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.</span>
<span class="verse 2Pet_3_9" data-osis="2Pet.3.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>The Lord is not slow to fulfil his promise, as some count slowness; but he is forbearing with you, as it is not his will that any of you should perish, but that all should be brought to repentance.</span>
<span class="verse 2Pet_3_10" data-osis="2Pet.3.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>The Day of the Lord will come like a thief; and on that day the heavens will pass away with a crash, the elements will be burnt up and dissolved, and the earth and all that is in it will be disclosed.</span>
<span class="verse 2Pet_3_11" data-osis="2Pet.3.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>Now, since all these things are in the process of dissolution, think what you yourselves ought to be &mdash; what holy and pious lives you ought to lead,</span>
<span class="verse 2Pet_3_12" data-osis="2Pet.3.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>while you await and hasten the coming of the Day of God. At its coming the heavens will be dissolved in fire, and the elements melted by heat,</span>
<span class="verse 2Pet_3_13" data-osis="2Pet.3.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>but we look for &lsquo;new heavens and a new earth,&rsquo; where righteousness shall have its home, in fulfilment of the promise of God.</span>
<span class="verse 2Pet_3_14" data-osis="2Pet.3.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>Therefore, dear friends, in expectation of these things, make every effort to be found by him spotless, blameless, and at peace.</span>
<span class="verse 2Pet_3_15" data-osis="2Pet.3.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>Regard our Lord&rsquo;s forbearance as your one hope of Salvation. This is what our dear Brother Paul wrote to you, with the wisdom that God gave him.</span>
<span class="verse 2Pet_3_16" data-osis="2Pet.3.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>It is the same in all his letters, when he speaks in them about these subjects. There are some things in them difficult to understand, which untaught and weak people distort, just as they do all other writings, to their own Ruin.</span>
<span class="verse 2Pet_3_17" data-osis="2Pet.3.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>Do you, therefore, dear friends, now that you know this beforehand, be on your guard against being led away by the errors of reckless people, and so lapsing from your present steadfastness;</span>
<span class="verse 2Pet_3_18" data-osis="2Pet.3.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>and advance in the love and knowledge of our Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ. All glory be to him now and for ever.</span>

<span class="verse 2Tim_2_1" data-osis="2Tim.2.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>Do you, then, my Child, find strength in the help which comes from the union with Christ Jesus;</span>
<span class="verse 2Tim_2_2" data-osis="2Tim.2.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>and what you learnt from me, in the presence of many listeners, entrust to reliable men, who will be able in their turn to teach others.</span>
<span class="verse 2Tim_2_3" data-osis="2Tim.2.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>Share hardships with me, as a true soldier of Christ Jesus.</span>
<span class="verse 2Tim_2_4" data-osis="2Tim.2.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>A soldier on active service, to please his superior officer, always avoids entangling himself in the affairs of ordinary life.</span>
<span class="verse 2Tim_2_5" data-osis="2Tim.2.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>No athlete is ever awarded the wreath of victory unless he has kept the rules.</span>
<span class="verse 2Tim_2_6" data-osis="2Tim.2.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>The labourer who does the work should be the first to receive a share of the fruits of the earth.</span>
<span class="verse 2Tim_2_7" data-osis="2Tim.2.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>Reflect upon what I say; the Lord will always help you to understand.</span>
<span class="verse 2Tim_2_8" data-osis="2Tim.2.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>Keep before your mind Jesus Christ, raised from the dead, a descendant of David, as told in the Good News entrusted to me;</span>
<span class="verse 2Tim_2_9" data-osis="2Tim.2.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>in the service of which I am suffering hardships, even to being put in fetters as a criminal. But the Message of God is not fettered;</span>
<span class="verse 2Tim_2_10" data-osis="2Tim.2.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>and that is why I submit to anything for the sake of God&rsquo;s People, that they also may obtain the Salvation which comes from union with Christ Jesus, and imperishable glory.</span>
<span class="verse 2Tim_2_11" data-osis="2Tim.2.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>How true this saying is &mdash;  &lsquo;If we have shared his death, we shall also share his life.</span>
<span class="verse 2Tim_2_12" data-osis="2Tim.2.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>If we continue to endure, we shall also share his throne. If we should ever disown him, he, too, will disown us.</span>
<span class="verse 2Tim_2_13" data-osis="2Tim.2.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>If we lose our trust, he is still to be trusted, for he cannot be false to himself!&rsquo;</span>
<span class="verse 2Tim_2_14" data-osis="2Tim.2.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>Remind people of all this; urge them solemnly, as in the sight of God, to avoid controversy, a useless thing and the ruin of those who listen to it.</span>
<span class="verse 2Tim_2_15" data-osis="2Tim.2.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>Do your utmost to show yourself true to God, a workman with no reason to be ashamed, accurate in delivering the Message of the Truth.</span>
<span class="verse 2Tim_2_16" data-osis="2Tim.2.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>Avoid profane prattle. Those who indulge in it only get deeper into irreligious ways,</span>
<span class="verse 2Tim_2_17" data-osis="2Tim.2.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>and their teaching will spread like a cancer. Hymenaeus and Philetus are instances of this.</span>
<span class="verse 2Tim_2_18" data-osis="2Tim.2.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>They have gone completely astray as regards the Truth; they say that a resurrection has already taken place, and so upset some people&rsquo;s faith.</span>
<span class="verse 2Tim_2_19" data-osis="2Tim.2.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>Yet God&rsquo;s firm foundation still stands unmoved, and it bears this inscription &mdash;  &lsquo;THE LORD KNOWS THOSE WHO ARE HIS&rsquo;; and this &mdash;  &lsquo;LET ALL THOSE WHO USE THE NAME OF THE LORD TURN AWAY FROM WICKEDNESS.&rsquo;</span>
<span class="verse 2Tim_2_20" data-osis="2Tim.2.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>Now in a large house there are not only things of gold and silver, but also others of wood and earthenware, some for better and some for common use.</span>
<span class="verse 2Tim_2_21" data-osis="2Tim.2.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>If, then, a man has escaped from the pollution of such errors as I have mentioned, he will be like a thing kept for better use, set apart, serviceable to its owner, ready for any good purpose.</span>
<span class="verse 2Tim_2_22" data-osis="2Tim.2.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>Flee from the passions of youth, but pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace, in the company of those who, with a pure heart, invoke the Lord.</span>
<span class="verse 2Tim_2_23" data-osis="2Tim.2.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>Shun foolish and ignorant discussions, for you know that they only breed quarrels;</span>
<span class="verse 2Tim_2_24" data-osis="2Tim.2.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span>and a Servant of the Lord should never quarrel. He ought, on the contrary, to be courteous to every one, a skillful teacher, and forbearing.</span>
<span class="verse 2Tim_2_25" data-osis="2Tim.2.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span>He should instruct his opponents in a gentle spirit; for, possibly, God may give them a repentance that will lead to a fuller knowledge of Truth,</span>
<span class="verse 2Tim_2_26" data-osis="2Tim.2.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span>and they may yet come to a sober mind, and escape from the snares of the Devil, when captured by the Lord&rsquo;s Servant to do the will of God.</span>

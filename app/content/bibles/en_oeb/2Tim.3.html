<span class="verse" data-osis="2Tim.3.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>Be sure of this, that in the last days difficult times will come.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Tim.3.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>Men will be selfish, mercenary, boastful, haughty, and blasphemous; disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, impure,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Tim.3.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>incapable of affection, merciless, slanderous, wanting in self-control, brutal, careless of the right,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Tim.3.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>treacherous, reckless, and puffed up with pride; they will love pleasure more than they love God;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Tim.3.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>and while they retain the outward form of religion, they will not allow it to influence them. Turn your back on such men as these.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Tim.3.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>For among them are to be found those who creep into homes and captivate weak women &mdash; women who, loaded with sins, and slaves to all kinds of passions,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Tim.3.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>are always learning, and yet never able to attain to a real knowledge of the Truth.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Tim.3.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>Just as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so do these people, in their turn, oppose the Truth. Their minds are corrupted, and, as regards the Faith, they are utterly worthless.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Tim.3.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>They will not, however, make further progress; for their wicked folly will be plain to every one, just as that of Jannes and Jambres was.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Tim.3.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>But you, Timothy, were a close observer of my teaching, my conduct, my purposes, my faith, my forbearance, my love, and my patient endurance,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Tim.3.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>as well as of my persecutions, and of the sufferings which I met with at Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra. You know what persecutions I underwent; and yet the Lord brought me safe out of all!</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Tim.3.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>Yes, and all who aim at living a religious life in union with Christ Jesus will have to suffer persecution;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Tim.3.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>but wicked people and impostors will go from bad to worse, deceiving others and deceived themselves.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Tim.3.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>You, however, must stand by what you learnt and accepted as true. You know who they were from whom you learnt it;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Tim.3.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>and that, from your childhood, you have known the Sacred Writings, which can give you the wisdom that, through belief in Christ Jesus, leads to Salvation.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Tim.3.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span>Everything that is written under divine inspiration is helpful for teaching, for refuting error, for giving guidance, and for training others in righteousness;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Tim.3.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span>so that the Servant of God may be perfect himself, and perfectly equipped for every good action.</span>

<h3>The Acts of the Apostles</h3>
<h2 class="chapter-num">1</h2>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.1.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>The first account which I drew up, Theophilus, dealt with all that Jesus did and taught from the very first,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.1.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>down to that day on which he was taken up to Heaven, after he had, by the help of the Holy Spirit, given instructions to the Apostles whom he had chosen.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.1.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>With abundant proofs, he showed himself to them, still living, after his death; appearing to them from time to time during forty days, and speaking of all that related to the Kingdom of God.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.1.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>And once, when he had gathered them together, he charged them not to leave Jerusalem, but to wait there for the fulfilment of the Father&rsquo;s promise &mdash; <span class="woc"> &ldquo;that promise,&rdquo;</span>  he said, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;of which you have heard me speak;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.1.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> for, while John baptized with water, you shall be baptized with the Holy Spirit before many days have passed.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.1.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>So, when the Apostles had met together, they asked Jesus this question &mdash; &ldquo;Master, is this the time when you intend to re-establish the Kingdom for Israel?&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.1.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>His answer was: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;It is not for you to know times or hours, for the Father has reserved these for his own decision;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.1.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> but you shall receive power, when the Holy Spirit shall have descended upon you, and shall be witnesses for me not only in Jerusalem, but throughout Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.1.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>No sooner had Jesus said this than he was caught up before their eyes, and a cloud received him from their sight.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.1.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>While they were still gazing up into the heavens, as he went, suddenly two men, clothed in white, stood beside them,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.1.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>and said: &ldquo;Men of Galilee, why are you standing here looking up into the heavens? This very Jesus, who has been taken from you into the heavens, will come in the very way in which you have seen him go into the heavens.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.1.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>Then the Apostles returned to Jerusalem from the hill called Olivet, which is about three quarters of a mile from the city.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.1.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>When they reached Jerusalem, they went to the upstairs room, where they were staying. There were there Peter, John, James, and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus, Simon the Zealot, and Judas the son of James.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.1.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>They all united in devoting themselves to Prayer, and so did some women, and Mary, the mother of Jesus, and his brothers.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.1.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>About this time, at a meeting of the Brethren, when there were about a hundred and twenty present, Peter rose to speak.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.1.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Brothers,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it was necessary that the prediction of Scripture should be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit made by the lips of David about Judas, who acted as guide to the men that arrested Jesus,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.1.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span>for he was one of our number and had his part allotted him in this work of ours.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.1.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span>(This man had bought a piece of land with the price of his treachery; and, falling heavily, his body had burst open, and all his bowels protruded.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.1.19"><span class="verse-num">19&nbsp;</span>This became known to every one living in Jerusalem, so that the field came to be called, in their language, &lsquo;Akeldama,&rsquo; which means the &lsquo;Field of Blood.&rsquo;)</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.1.20"><span class="verse-num">20&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;For in the Book of Psalms,&rdquo; Peter continued, &ldquo;it is said &mdash;  &lsquo;Let his dwelling become desolate, and let no one live in it&rsquo;; and also &mdash; &lsquo;His office let another take.&rsquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.1.21"><span class="verse-num">21&nbsp;</span>Therefore, from among the men who have been with us all the time that Jesus, our Master, went in and out among us &mdash;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.1.22"><span class="verse-num">22&nbsp;</span>From his baptism by John down to that day on which he was taken from us &mdash; some one must be found to join us as a witness of his resurrection.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.1.23"><span class="verse-num">23&nbsp;</span>So they put forward two men, Joseph called Barsabas, whose other name was Justus, and Matthias;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.1.24"><span class="verse-num">24&nbsp;</span>and they offered this prayer &mdash; &ldquo;O Lord, who reads all hearts, show which of these two men you have chosen</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.1.25"><span class="verse-num">25&nbsp;</span>To take the place in this apostolic work, which Judas has abandoned, to go to his proper place.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.1.26"><span class="verse-num">26&nbsp;</span>Then they drew lots between them; and, the lot having fallen on Matthias, he was added to the number of the eleven Apostles.</span>

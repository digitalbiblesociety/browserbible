<h5>The Doings of the Apostles Peter and John</h5>
<span class="verse Acts_1_1" data-osis="Acts.1.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>The first account which I drew up, Theophilus, dealt with all that Jesus did and taught from the very first,</span>
<span class="verse Acts_1_2" data-osis="Acts.1.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>down to that day on which he was taken up to heaven, after he had, by the help of the Holy Spirit, given instructions to the apostles whom he had chosen.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_1_3" data-osis="Acts.1.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>With abundant proofs, he showed himself to them, still living, after his death; appearing to them from time to time during forty days, and speaking of all that related to the kingdom of God.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_1_4" data-osis="Acts.1.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>And once, when he had gathered them together, he charged them not to leave Jerusalem, but to wait there for the fulfillment of the Father’s promise — <span class="woc">“that promise,”</span>he said, <span class="woc">“of which you have heard me speak;</span></span>
<span class="verse Acts_1_5" data-osis="Acts.1.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">for, while John baptized with water, you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit before many days have passed.”</span></span>
<p>
<span class="verse Acts_1_6" data-osis="Acts.1.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>So, when the apostles had met together, they asked Jesus this question — “Master, is this the time when you intend to re-establish the kingdom for Israel?”</span>
<span class="verse Acts_1_7" data-osis="Acts.1.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>His answer was: <span class="woc">“It is not for you to know times or hours, for the Father has reserved these for his own decision;</span></span>
<span class="verse Acts_1_8" data-osis="Acts.1.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">but you will receive power, when the Holy Spirit will have descended on you, and will be witnesses for me not only in Jerusalem, but throughout Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.”</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Acts_1_9" data-osis="Acts.1.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>No sooner had Jesus said this than he was caught up before their eyes, and a cloud received him from their sight.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_1_10" data-osis="Acts.1.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>While they were still gazing up into the heavens, as he went, suddenly two men, clothed in white, stood beside them,</span>
<span class="verse Acts_1_11" data-osis="Acts.1.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>and said: “People of Galilee, why are you standing here looking up into the heavens? This same Jesus, who has been taken from you into the heavens, will come in the same way in which you have seen him go into the heavens.”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Acts_1_12" data-osis="Acts.1.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>Then the apostles returned to Jerusalem from the hill called Olivet, which is about three quarters of a mile from the city.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_1_13" data-osis="Acts.1.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>When they reached Jerusalem, they went to the upstairs room, where they were staying. There were there Peter, John, James, and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus, Simon the Zealot, and Judas the son of James.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_1_14" data-osis="Acts.1.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>They all united in devoting themselves to prayer, and so did some women, and Mary, the mother of Jesus, and his brothers.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_1_15" data-osis="Acts.1.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>About this time, at a meeting of the Lord's followers, when there were about a hundred and twenty present, Peter rose to speak.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_1_16" data-osis="Acts.1.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>“Friends,” he said, “it was necessary who the prediction of scripture should be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit made by the lips of David about Judas, who acted as guide to the men that arrested Jesus,</span>
<span class="verse Acts_1_17" data-osis="Acts.1.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>for he was one of our number and had his part allotted him in this work of ours.”</span>
<span class="verse Acts_1_18" data-osis="Acts.1.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>(This man had bought a piece of land with the price of his treachery; and, falling heavily, his body had burst open, and all his bowels protruded.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_1_19" data-osis="Acts.1.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>This became known to everyone living in Jerusalem, so that the field came to be called, in their language, ‘Akeldama,’ which means the ‘Field of Blood.’)</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Acts_1_20" data-osis="Acts.1.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>“For in the book of Psalms,” Peter continued, “it is said —<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘Let his home,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And let no one live in it’;<br /><br />and also —<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘His office let another take.’<br /><br /></span>
<span class="verse Acts_1_21" data-osis="Acts.1.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>Therefore, from among the men who have been with us all the time that Jesus, our Master, went in and out among us —</span>
<span class="verse Acts_1_22" data-osis="Acts.1.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>From his baptism by John down to that day on which he was taken from us — some one must be found to join us as a witness of his resurrection.”</span>
<span class="verse Acts_1_23" data-osis="Acts.1.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>So they put forward two men, Joseph called Barsabas, whose other name was Justus, and Matthias;</span>
<span class="verse Acts_1_24" data-osis="Acts.1.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span>and they offered this prayer —<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Lord, who reads all hearts, show which of these two men you have chosen</span>
<span class="verse Acts_1_25" data-osis="Acts.1.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span>To take the place in this apostolic work, which Judas has abandoned, to go to his proper place.”<br /><br /></span>
<span class="verse Acts_1_26" data-osis="Acts.1.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span>Then they drew lots between them; and, the lot having fallen on Matthias, he was added to the number of the eleven apostles.</span>

<span class="verse Acts_10_1" data-osis="Acts.10.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>There was then in Caesarea a man named Cornelius, a Captain in the regiment known as the &lsquo;Italian Regiment,&rsquo;</span>
<span class="verse Acts_10_2" data-osis="Acts.10.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>A religious man and one who reverenced God, with all his household. He was liberal in his charities to the people, and prayed to God constantly.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_10_3" data-osis="Acts.10.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>One afternoon, about three o&rsquo;clock, he distinctly saw in a vision an angel from God come to him, and call him by name.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_10_4" data-osis="Acts.10.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>Cornelius fixed his eyes on him and, in great alarm, said: &ldquo;What is it, Lord?&rdquo; &ldquo;Your prayers and your charities,&rdquo; the angel answered, &ldquo;have been an acceptable offering to God.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_10_5" data-osis="Acts.10.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>And now, send messengers to Jaffa and fetch a man called Simon, who is also known as Peter.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_10_6" data-osis="Acts.10.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>He is lodging with a tanner named Simon, who has a house near the sea.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Acts_10_7" data-osis="Acts.10.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>When the angel, who had spoken to him, had gone, Cornelius called two menservants and a religious soldier, who was one of his constant attendants,</span>
<span class="verse Acts_10_8" data-osis="Acts.10.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>and, after telling them the whole story, sent them to Jaffa.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_10_9" data-osis="Acts.10.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>On the next day, while these men were on their way, just as they were nearing the town, Peter went up on the housetop about mid-day to pray.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_10_10" data-osis="Acts.10.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>He became hungry and wanted something to eat; but while it was being prepared, he fell into a trance,</span>
<span class="verse Acts_10_11" data-osis="Acts.10.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>and saw that the heavens were open, and that something like a great sail was descending, let down by its four corners towards the earth.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_10_12" data-osis="Acts.10.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>In it were all kinds of quadrupeds, reptiles, and birds.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_10_13" data-osis="Acts.10.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>Then he was aware of a voice which said &mdash; <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Stand up, Peter, kill something, and eat.&rdquo;</span></span>
<span class="verse Acts_10_14" data-osis="Acts.10.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;No, Lord, I cannot,&rdquo; answered Peter, &ldquo;for I have never eaten anything &lsquo;defiled&rsquo; and &lsquo;unclean&rsquo;.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Acts_10_15" data-osis="Acts.10.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>Again he was aware of a voice which said &mdash; <span class="woc"> &ldquo;What God has pronounced &lsquo;clean&rsquo;, do not regard as &lsquo;defiled&rsquo;.&rdquo;</span></span>
<span class="verse Acts_10_16" data-osis="Acts.10.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>This happened three times, and then suddenly it was all taken up into the heavens.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_10_17" data-osis="Acts.10.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>While Peter was still perplexed as to the meaning of the vision that he had seen, the men sent by Cornelius, having enquired the way to Simon&rsquo;s house, came up to the gate,</span>
<span class="verse Acts_10_18" data-osis="Acts.10.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>and called out and asked if the Simon, who was also known as Peter, was lodging there.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_10_19" data-osis="Acts.10.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>Peter was still pondering over the vision, when the Spirit said to him: &ldquo;There are two men looking for you at this moment.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_10_20" data-osis="Acts.10.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>Go down at once and do not hesitate to go with them, for I have sent them.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Acts_10_21" data-osis="Acts.10.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>Peter went down to the men and said: &ldquo;I am the man for whom you are looking. What is your reason for coming?&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Acts_10_22" data-osis="Acts.10.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>The men replied: &ldquo;Our captain, Cornelius, a pious man who reverences God and is well spoken of by the whole Jewish nation, has been instructed by a holy angel to send for you to his house, and to listen to what you have to say.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Acts_10_23" data-osis="Acts.10.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>Upon this Peter invited them in and entertained them. The next day he lost no time in setting out with them, accompanied by some of the Brethren from Jaffa;</span>
<span class="verse Acts_10_24" data-osis="Acts.10.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span>and the day following he entered Caesarea. Cornelius was expecting them, and had invited his relations and intimate friends to meet them.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_10_25" data-osis="Acts.10.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span>So, when Peter entered the city, Cornelius met him, and, throwing himself at Peter&rsquo;s feet, bowed to the ground.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_10_26" data-osis="Acts.10.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span>Peter, however, lifted him up, saying as he did so: &ldquo;Stand up, I am only a man like yourself.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Acts_10_27" data-osis="Acts.10.27"><span class="verse-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span>Talking with him as he went, Peter entered the house, where he found a large gathering of people, to whom he said:</span>
<span class="verse Acts_10_28" data-osis="Acts.10.28"><span class="verse-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;You are doubtless aware that it is forbidden for a Jew to be intimate with a foreigner, or even to enter his house; and yet God has shown me that I ought not to call any man &lsquo;defiled&rsquo; or &lsquo;unclean.&rsquo;</span>
<span class="verse Acts_10_29" data-osis="Acts.10.29"><span class="verse-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span>That was why I came, when I was sent for, without raising any objection. And now I ask your reason for sending for me.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Acts_10_30" data-osis="Acts.10.30"><span class="verse-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Just three days ago this very hour,&rdquo; Cornelius said, &ldquo;I was in my house, saying the Afternoon Prayers, when a man in dazzling clothing suddenly stood before me.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_10_31" data-osis="Acts.10.31"><span class="verse-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span>&lsquo;Cornelius,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;your prayer has been heard, and your charities have been accepted, by God.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_10_32" data-osis="Acts.10.32"><span class="verse-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span>Therefore send to Jaffa, and invite the Simon, who is also known as Peter, to come here. He is lodging in the house of Simon the tanner, near the sea.&rsquo;</span>
<span class="verse Acts_10_33" data-osis="Acts.10.33"><span class="verse-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span>Accordingly I sent to you at once, and you have been so good as to come. And now we are all here in the presence of God, to listen to all that you have been instructed by the Lord to say.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Acts_10_34" data-osis="Acts.10.34"><span class="verse-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span>Then Peter began. &ldquo;I see, beyond all doubt,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that &lsquo;God does not show partiality,&rsquo;</span>
<span class="verse Acts_10_35" data-osis="Acts.10.35"><span class="verse-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span>But that in every nation he who reverences him and does what is right is acceptable to him.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_10_36" data-osis="Acts.10.36"><span class="verse-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span>God has sent his Message to the Israelites and told them, through Jesus Christ, the Good News of peace &mdash; and Jesus is Lord of all!</span>
<span class="verse Acts_10_37" data-osis="Acts.10.37"><span class="verse-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span>You yourselves know the story which spread through all Judea, how, beginning form Galilee, after the baptism which John proclaimed &mdash;</span>
<span class="verse Acts_10_38" data-osis="Acts.10.38"><span class="verse-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span>The story, I mean, of Jesus of Nazareth, and how God consecrated him his Christ by enduing him with the Holy Spirit and with power; and how he went about doing good and curing all who were under the power of the Devil, because God was with him.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_10_39" data-osis="Acts.10.39"><span class="verse-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span>We are ourselves, too, witnesses to all that he did in Judea and in Jerusalem; yet they put him to death by hanging him on a cross!</span>
<span class="verse Acts_10_40" data-osis="Acts.10.40"><span class="verse-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span>This Jesus God raised on the third day, and enabled him to appear,</span>
<span class="verse Acts_10_41" data-osis="Acts.10.41"><span class="verse-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span>not indeed to every one, but to witnesses chosen beforehand by God &mdash; to us, who ate and drank with him after his resurrection from the dead.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_10_42" data-osis="Acts.10.42"><span class="verse-num v-42">42&nbsp;</span>Further, God charged us to proclaim to the people, and solemnly affirm, that it is Jesus who has been appointed by God Judge of the living and the dead.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_10_43" data-osis="Acts.10.43"><span class="verse-num v-43">43&nbsp;</span>To him it is that all the Prophets bear witness, when they say that every one who believes in him receives through his Name forgiveness of sins.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Acts_10_44" data-osis="Acts.10.44"><span class="verse-num v-44">44&nbsp;</span>Before Peter had finished saying these words, the Holy Spirit fell on all who were listening to the Message.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_10_45" data-osis="Acts.10.45"><span class="verse-num v-45">45&nbsp;</span>Those converts from Judaism, who had come with Peter, were amazed that the gift of the Holy Spirit had been bestowed even upon the Gentiles;</span>
<span class="verse Acts_10_46" data-osis="Acts.10.46"><span class="verse-num v-46">46&nbsp;</span>for they heard them speaking with &lsquo;tongues&rsquo; and extolling God. At this Peter asked:</span>
<span class="verse Acts_10_47" data-osis="Acts.10.47"><span class="verse-num v-47">47&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Can any one refuse the water for the baptism of these people, now that they have received the Holy Spirit as we did ourselves?&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Acts_10_48" data-osis="Acts.10.48"><span class="verse-num v-48">48&nbsp;</span>And he directed that they should be baptized in the Faith of Jesus Christ; after which they asked him to stay there a few days longer.</span>

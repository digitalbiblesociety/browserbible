<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.14.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>The same thing occurred in Iconium, where Paul and Barnabas went into the Jewish Synagogue, and spoke in such a way that a great number of both Jews and Greeks believed in Christ.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.14.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>But the Jews who refused to believe stirred up the Gentiles, and poisoned their minds against the Brethren.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.14.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>Therefore Paul and Barnabas spent a long time there, and spoke out fearlessly, relying upon the Lord, who confirmed the Message of his Love by permitting signs and wonders to take place at their hands.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.14.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>But the townspeople were divided, some siding with the Jews, some with the Apostles;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.14.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>and, when there was an attempt on the part of both Gentiles and Jews, with their leading men, to resort to violence and to stone them,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.14.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>the Apostles heard of it, and took refuge in Lystra and Derbe, towns in Lycaonia, and in the district round,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.14.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>and there they continued to tell the Good News.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.14.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>In the streets of Lystra there used to sit a man who had no power in his feet; he had been lame from his birth, and had never walked.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.14.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>This man was listening to Paul speaking, when Paul, fixing his eyes on him, and seeing that he had the faith to be healed,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.14.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>said loudly: &ldquo;Stand upright on your feet.&rdquo; The man leaped up, and began walking about,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.14.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>and the crowd, seeing what Paul had done, called out in the Lycaonian language: &ldquo;The Gods have made themselves like men and have come down to us.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.14.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>So they called Barnabas &lsquo;Zeus,&rsquo; and Paul &lsquo;Hermes,&rsquo; because he took the lead in speaking;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.14.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>and the priest of Zeus-beyond-the-Walls, accompanied by the crowd, brought bullocks and garlands to the gates, with the intention of offering sacrifices.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.14.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>But, when the Apostles Barnabas and Paul heard of it, they tore their clothes and rushed out into the crowd. &ldquo;Friends, why are you doing this?&rdquo; they shouted.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.14.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;We are only men like yourselves, and we have come with the Good News that you should turn away from these follies to a living God, &lsquo;who made the heavens, the earth, the sea, and everything that is in them.&rsquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.14.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span>In bygone times he permitted all the nations to go their own ways.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.14.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span>Yet he has not failed to give you, in the good he does, some revelation of himself &mdash; sending you from heaven rain and fruitful seasons, and gladdening your hearts with plenty and good cheer.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.14.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span>Even with this appeal they could hardly restrain the people from offering sacrifice to them.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.14.19"><span class="verse-num">19&nbsp;</span>Presently, however, there came some Jews from Antioch, and Iconium who, after they had won over the people, stoned Paul, and dragged him out of the town, thinking him to be dead.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.14.20"><span class="verse-num">20&nbsp;</span>But, when the disciples had gathered round him, he got up and went back into the town; the next day he went with Barnabas to Derbe.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.14.21"><span class="verse-num">21&nbsp;</span>After telling the Good News throughout that town, and making a number of converts, they returned to Lystra, Iconium, and Antioch,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.14.22"><span class="verse-num">22&nbsp;</span>reassuring the minds of the disciples, urging them to remain true to the Faith, and showing that it is only through many troubles that we can enter the Kingdom of God.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.14.23"><span class="verse-num">23&nbsp;</span>They also appointed Officers for them in every Church, and, after prayer and fasting, commended them to the Lord in whom they had learned to believe.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.14.24"><span class="verse-num">24&nbsp;</span>Paul and Barnabas then went through Pisidia, and came into Pamphylia,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.14.25"><span class="verse-num">25&nbsp;</span>and, after telling the Message at Perga, went down to Attaleia.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.14.26"><span class="verse-num">26&nbsp;</span>From there they sailed to Antioch &mdash; the place where they had been committed to the gracious care of God for the work which they had now finished.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.14.27"><span class="verse-num">27&nbsp;</span>After their arrival, they gathered the Church together, and gave an account of all that God had helped them to do, and especially how he had opened to the Gentiles the door of faith;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.14.28"><span class="verse-num">28&nbsp;</span>and at Antioch they stayed with the disciples for a considerable time.</span>

<span class="verse Acts_15_1" data-osis="Acts.15.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>But certain persons came down from Judea, and began to teach the Brethren that, unless they were circumcised, in accordance with the custom enjoined by Moses, they could not be saved.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_15_2" data-osis="Acts.15.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>This gave rise to a serious dispute, and much discussion, between Paul and Barnabas and these men, and it was therefore settled that Paul and Barnabas and others of their number should go up to Jerusalem, to consult the Apostles and Officers of the Church about the matter under discussion.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_15_3" data-osis="Acts.15.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>The Church, therefore, sent them on their journey, and they made their way through Phoenicia and Samaria, telling the story of the conversion of the Gentiles, to the great joy of all the Brethren.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_15_4" data-osis="Acts.15.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>On their arrival at Jerusalem, they were welcomed by the Church, as well as by the Apostles and the Officers, and gave an account of all that God had helped them to do.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_15_5" data-osis="Acts.15.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>Some of the Pharisees&rsquo; party, however, who had become believers in Christ, came forward and declared that they were bound to circumcise converts and to direct them to observe the Law of Moses.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_15_6" data-osis="Acts.15.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>The Apostles and the Officers of the Church held a meeting to consider this question.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_15_7" data-osis="Acts.15.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>After much discussion, Peter rose and said: &ldquo;You, my Brothers, know well that long ago God singled me out &mdash; that through my lips the Gentiles should hear the Message of the Good News, and become believers in Christ.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_15_8" data-osis="Acts.15.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>Now God, who reads all hearts, declared his acceptance of the Gentiles, by giving them the Holy Spirit, just as he did to us.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_15_9" data-osis="Acts.15.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>He made no distinction between them and us, when he purified their hearts by their faith.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_15_10" data-osis="Acts.15.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>Why, then, do you now provoke God, by putting on the necks of these disciples a yoke which neither our ancestors nor we were able to bear?</span>
<span class="verse Acts_15_11" data-osis="Acts.15.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>No, it is through the loving-kindness of the Lord Jesus that we, just as they do, believe that we have been saved.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Acts_15_12" data-osis="Acts.15.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>Every voice in the assembly was hushed, as they listened to Barnabas and Paul, while they gave an account of all the signs and wonders which God had shown among the Gentiles through them.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_15_13" data-osis="Acts.15.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>After they had finished speaking, James addressed the Council. &ldquo;Brothers,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;hear what I have to say.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_15_14" data-osis="Acts.15.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>Simon has described the manner in which God first visited the Gentiles, in order to take from among them a people to bear his Name.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_15_15" data-osis="Acts.15.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>And that is in harmony with the words of the Prophets, where they say &mdash;</span>
<span class="verse Acts_15_16" data-osis="Acts.15.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>&lsquo;&ldquo;After this I will return; and I will rebuild the House of David which has fallen &mdash; its very ruins I will rebuild, and will set it up once more;</span>
<span class="verse Acts_15_17" data-osis="Acts.15.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>that so the rest of mankind may earnestly seek the Lord &mdash; even all the Gentiles on whom my Name has been bestowed.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Acts_15_18" data-osis="Acts.15.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>Says the Lord, as he does these things, foreknown from of old.&rsquo;</span>
<span class="verse Acts_15_19" data-osis="Acts.15.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>In my judgment, therefore, we should not add to the difficulties of those Gentiles who are turning to God,</span>
<span class="verse Acts_15_20" data-osis="Acts.15.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>but we should write to them to abstain from food that has been polluted by being sacrificed to idols, from impurity, from eating the flesh of strangled animals, and from blood.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_15_21" data-osis="Acts.15.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>For in every town, for generations past, there have been those who preach Moses, read as he is in the Synagogues every Sabbath.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Acts_15_22" data-osis="Acts.15.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>It was then decided by the Apostles and the Officers, with the assent of the whole Church, to choose some of their number, and send them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas. Those chosen were Judas (called Barsabas) and Silas, who were leading men among the Brethren.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_15_23" data-osis="Acts.15.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>They were bearers of the following letter &mdash; &lsquo;The Apostles, and the Brothers who are the Officers of the Church, send their greetings to the Brethren of Gentile birth in Antioch, Syria, and Cilicia.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_15_24" data-osis="Acts.15.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span>As we had heard that some of our number had upset you by their assertions, and unsettled your minds &mdash; without instructions from us &mdash;</span>
<span class="verse Acts_15_25" data-osis="Acts.15.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span>We met and decided to choose certain men and send them to you with our dear brothers Barnabas and Paul,</span>
<span class="verse Acts_15_26" data-osis="Acts.15.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span>who have sacrificed themselves for the Name of our Lord, Jesus Christ.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_15_27" data-osis="Acts.15.27"><span class="verse-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span>We are accordingly sending Judas and Silas, and they will tell you by word of mouth what we are now writing.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_15_28" data-osis="Acts.15.28"><span class="verse-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span>We have, therefore, decided, under the guidance of the Holy Spirit, to lay no further burden upon you beyond these necessary conditions &mdash;</span>
<span class="verse Acts_15_29" data-osis="Acts.15.29"><span class="verse-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span>That you abstain from food offered to idols, from blood, from eating the flesh of strangled animals, and from impurity. If you guard yourselves against such things, it will be well with you. Farewell.&rsquo;</span>
<span class="verse Acts_15_30" data-osis="Acts.15.30"><span class="verse-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span>So the bearers of this letter were sent on their way, and went down to Antioch. There they called a meeting of all the brethren,</span>
<span class="verse Acts_15_31" data-osis="Acts.15.31"><span class="verse-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span>and delivered the letter, the reading of which caused great rejoicing by its encouraging contents.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_15_32" data-osis="Acts.15.32"><span class="verse-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span>Judas and Silas, who were themselves Prophets, further encouraged the Brethren by many an address, and strengthened their faith.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_15_33" data-osis="Acts.15.33"><span class="verse-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span>After some stay, they were dismissed with kind farewells from the Brethren, and returned to those who had sent them.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_15_35" data-osis="Acts.15.35"><span class="verse-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span>Paul and Barnabas, however, remained in Antioch, where they taught and, with the help of many others, told the Good News of the Lord&rsquo;s Message.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_15_36" data-osis="Acts.15.36"><span class="verse-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span>Some time after this, Paul said to Barnabas: &ldquo;Let us go back and visit the Brethren in every town in which we have told the Lord&rsquo;s Message, and see how they are prospering.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Acts_15_37" data-osis="Acts.15.37"><span class="verse-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span>Barnabas wished to take with them John, whose other name was Mark;</span>
<span class="verse Acts_15_38" data-osis="Acts.15.38"><span class="verse-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span>but Paul felt that they ought not to take with them the man who had deserted them in Pamphylia, and had not gone on with them to their work.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_15_39" data-osis="Acts.15.39"><span class="verse-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span>This caused such unpleasant feeling between them that they parted, Barnabas taking Mark and sailing for Cyprus,</span>
<span class="verse Acts_15_40" data-osis="Acts.15.40"><span class="verse-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span>while Paul chose Silas for his companion and, after he had been committed by the Brethren to the gracious care of the Lord,</span>
<span class="verse Acts_15_41" data-osis="Acts.15.41"><span class="verse-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span>started on his journey and went through Syria and Cilicia, strengthening the Churches in the faith.</span>

<h2 class="chapter-num">17</h2>
<p>
<span class="verse Acts_17_1" data-osis="Acts.17.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>After passing through Amphipolis and Apollonia, Paul and Silas came to Thessalonica. Here the Jews had a synagogue;</span>
<span class="verse Acts_17_2" data-osis="Acts.17.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>and, following his usual custom, Paul joined them, and for three Sabbaths addressed them, drawing his arguments from the scriptures.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_17_3" data-osis="Acts.17.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>He laid before them and explained that the Christ must undergo suffering and rise from the dead; and “It is this man,” he declared, “who is the Christ — this Jesus about whom I am telling you.”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Acts_17_4" data-osis="Acts.17.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>Some of the people were convinced, and threw in their lot with Paul and Silas, as did also a large body of Greeks who were accustomed to join in the Jewish services, and a great number of leading women.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_17_5" data-osis="Acts.17.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>But the Jewish leaders, becoming jealous, engaged some worthless fellows from the streets, and, getting a mob together, kept the city in an uproar. They attacked Jason’s house, with the intention of bringing Paul and Silas before the Popular Assembly;</span>
<span class="verse Acts_17_6" data-osis="Acts.17.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>and, not finding them there, they proceeded to drag Jason and some of the Lord's followers before the city magistrates, shouting out:</span>
</p>
<p>“These men, who have turned the world upside down, have now come here,
<span class="verse Acts_17_7" data-osis="Acts.17.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>and have been harbored by Jason! They say that some one else is king — a man called Jesus!”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Acts_17_8" data-osis="Acts.17.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>On hearing this, the people and the city magistrates were much concerned;</span>
<span class="verse Acts_17_9" data-osis="Acts.17.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>and, before letting them go, they took bail from Jason and the others.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_17_10" data-osis="Acts.17.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>That very night the followers sent Paul and Silas off to Beroea; and on reaching that place, they went to the Jewish synagogue.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_17_11" data-osis="Acts.17.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>These Jews of Beroea were better disposed than those in Thessalonica, for they welcomed the message with great readiness, and daily examined the scriptures to see if what was said was true.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_17_12" data-osis="Acts.17.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>As a consequence, many of them became believers in Christ, besides a considerable number of Greek women of position, and of men also.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_17_13" data-osis="Acts.17.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>But, when the Jewish leaders in Thessalonica found out that God’s message had been delivered by Paul at Beroea, they came there too, exciting and disturbing the minds of the people.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_17_14" data-osis="Acts.17.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>The followers immediately arranged for Paul to go away to the coast, but both Silas and Timothy stayed behind in Beroea.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_17_15" data-osis="Acts.17.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>The friends who escorted Paul took him as far as Athens, and, after receiving a message for Silas and Timothy to join him as quickly as possible, they started on their return.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_17_16" data-osis="Acts.17.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>While Paul was waiting for them at Athens, his heart was stirred at seeing the whole city full of idols.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_17_17" data-osis="Acts.17.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>So he argued in the synagogue with the Jews and with those who joined in their worship, as well as daily in the public Square with those who happened to be there.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_17_18" data-osis="Acts.17.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>Among others, some Epicurean and Stoic Philosophers joined issue with him. Some asked “What is this prater wanting to make out?”, while others said “He seems to be a preacher of foreign Deities.” (This was because he was telling the good news about Jesus and the resurrection).</span>
<span class="verse Acts_17_19" data-osis="Acts.17.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>So they laid hold of him and took him to the Court of Areopagus.</span>
</p>
<p>“May we hear,” they asked, “what new teaching this is which you are giving?
<span class="verse Acts_17_20" data-osis="Acts.17.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>For you are bringing some strange things to our notice, and we should like to know what they mean.”</span>
<span class="verse Acts_17_21" data-osis="Acts.17.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>(All Athenians and the foreigners staying in the city found no time for anything else but telling, or listening to, the last new thing.)</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Acts_17_22" data-osis="Acts.17.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>So Paul took his stand in the middle of the Court, and said — “People of Athens, on every hand I see signs of your being very devout.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_17_23" data-osis="Acts.17.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>For as I was going about, looking at your sacred shrines, I came upon an altar with this inscription — ‘To an Unknown God.’ What, therefore, you worship in ignorance, that I am now proclaiming to you.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_17_24" data-osis="Acts.17.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span>The God who made the world and all things that are in it —  he, Lord as he is of heaven and Earth, does not live in temples made by hands,</span>
<span class="verse Acts_17_25" data-osis="Acts.17.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span>neither do human hands minister to his wants, as though he needed anything, since he himself gives, to all, life, and breath, and all things.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_17_26" data-osis="Acts.17.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span>He made all races of the earth’s surface — fixing a time for their rise and fall, and the limits of their settlements —</span>
<span class="verse Acts_17_27" data-osis="Acts.17.27"><span class="verse-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span>That they might search for God, if by any means they might feel their way to him and find him. And yet he is not really far from any one of us;</span>
<span class="verse Acts_17_28" data-osis="Acts.17.28"><span class="verse-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span>for in him we live and move and are. To use the words of some of your own poets —<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘His offspring, too, are we.’<br /><br /></span>
<span class="verse Acts_17_29" data-osis="Acts.17.29"><span class="verse-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span>Therefore, as the offspring of God, we must not think that the Deity has any resemblance to anything made of gold, or silver, or stone — a work of human art and imagination.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_17_30" data-osis="Acts.17.30"><span class="verse-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span>True, God looked with indulgence on the days of people’s ignorance, but now he is announcing to everyone everywhere the need for repentance,</span>
<span class="verse Acts_17_31" data-osis="Acts.17.31"><span class="verse-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span>because he has fixed a day on which he intends to ‘judge the world with justice,’ by a man whom he has appointed — and of this he has given all people a pledge by raising this man from the dead.”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Acts_17_32" data-osis="Acts.17.32"><span class="verse-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span>On hearing of a resurrection of the dead, some began jeering, but others said that they wanted to hear what he had to say about that another time.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_17_33" data-osis="Acts.17.33"><span class="verse-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span>And so Paul left the Court.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_17_34" data-osis="Acts.17.34"><span class="verse-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span>There were, however, some people who joined him, and became believers in Christ. Among them were Dionysius, a member of the Court of Areopagus, a woman named Damaris, and several others.</span>

<h2 class="chapter-num">18</h2>
<p>
<span class="verse Acts_18_1" data-osis="Acts.18.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>On leaving Athens, Paul next went to Corinth.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_18_2" data-osis="Acts.18.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>There he met a Jew of the name of Aquila, from Pontus, who, with his wife Priscilla, had lately come from Italy, in consequence of the order which had been issued by the Emperor Claudius for all Jews to leave Rome. Paul paid them a visit,</span>
<span class="verse Acts_18_3" data-osis="Acts.18.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>and, since their trade was the same as his, he stayed and worked with them — their trade was tent-making.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_18_4" data-osis="Acts.18.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>Every Sabbath Paul gave addresses in the synagogue, trying to convince both Jews and Greeks.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Acts_18_5" data-osis="Acts.18.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>But, when Silas and Timothy had come down from Macedonia, Paul devoted himself entirely to delivering the message, earnestly maintaining before the Jews that Jesus was the Christ.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_18_6" data-osis="Acts.18.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>However, as they set themselves against him and became abusive, Paul shook his clothes in protest and said to them: “Your blood be on your own heads. My conscience is clear. From this time forward I will go to the Gentiles.”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Acts_18_7" data-osis="Acts.18.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>So he left, and went to the house of a certain Titius Justus, who had been accustomed to join in the worship of God, and whose house was next door to the synagogue.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_18_8" data-osis="Acts.18.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>Crispus, the synagogue leader, came to believe in the Lord, and so did all his household; and many of the Corinthians, as they listened to Paul, became believers in Christ and were baptized.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_18_9" data-osis="Acts.18.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>One night the Lord said to Paul, in a vision: <span class="woc">“Have no fear, but continue to speak, and refuse to be silenced;</span></span>
<span class="verse Acts_18_10" data-osis="Acts.18.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">for I am with you, and no one will do you harm, for I have many people in this city.”</span></span>
<span class="verse Acts_18_11" data-osis="Acts.18.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>So he settled there for a year and a half, and taught God’s message among the people.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Acts_18_12" data-osis="Acts.18.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>While Gallio was governor of Greece, some of the Jewish leaders made a combined attack on Paul, and brought him before the Governor’s Bench,</span>
<span class="verse Acts_18_13" data-osis="Acts.18.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>charging him with persuading people to worship God in a way forbidden by the law.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_18_14" data-osis="Acts.18.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>Just as Paul was on the point of speaking, Gallio said to them:</span>
</p>
<p>“If this were a case of misdemeanor or some serious crime, there would be some reason for my listening patiently to you;
<span class="verse Acts_18_15" data-osis="Acts.18.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>but, since it is a dispute about words, and names, and your own law, you must see to it yourselves. I do not choose to be a judge in such matters.”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Acts_18_16" data-osis="Acts.18.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>Saying this, he drove them back from the Bench.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_18_17" data-osis="Acts.18.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>Then they all set on Sosthenes, the synagogue leader, and beat him in front of the Bench, but Gallio did not trouble himself about any of these things.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Acts_18_18" data-osis="Acts.18.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>Paul remained there some time after this, and then took leave of the followers, and sailed to Syria with Priscilla and Aquila, but not before his head had been shaved at Cenchreae, because he was under a vow.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_18_19" data-osis="Acts.18.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>They put into Ephesus, and there Paul, leaving his companions, went into the synagogue and addressed the Jews.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_18_20" data-osis="Acts.18.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>When they asked him to prolong his stay, he declined, saying however,</span>
<span class="verse Acts_18_21" data-osis="Acts.18.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>as he took his leave, “I will come back again to you, please God,” and then set sail from Ephesus.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_18_22" data-osis="Acts.18.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>On reaching Caesarea, he went up to Jerusalem and exchanged greetings with the church, and then went down to Antioch.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_18_23" data-osis="Acts.18.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>After making some stay in Antioch, he set out on a tour through the Phrygian district of Galatia, strengthening the faith of all the disciples as he went.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_18_24" data-osis="Acts.18.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span>Meanwhile there had come to Ephesus an Alexandrian Jew, named Apollos, an eloquent man, who was well-versed in the scriptures.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_18_25" data-osis="Acts.18.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span>He had been well-instructed in the cause of the Lord, and with burning zeal he spoke of, and taught carefully, the facts about Jesus, though he knew of no baptism but John’s.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_18_26" data-osis="Acts.18.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span>This man began to speak out fearlessly in the synagogue; and when Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they took him home and explained the cause of God to him more carefully still.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_18_27" data-osis="Acts.18.27"><span class="verse-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span>When he wanted to cross to Greece, the followers furthered his plans, and wrote to the disciples there to welcome him. On his arrival he proved of great assistance to those who had, through the loving kindness of God, become believers in Christ,</span>
<span class="verse Acts_18_28" data-osis="Acts.18.28"><span class="verse-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span>for he vigorously confuted the Jews, publicly proving by the scriptures that Jesus was the Christ.</span>

<h2 class="chapter-num">2</h2>
<p>
<span class="verse Acts_2_1" data-osis="Acts.2.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>In the course of the Festival at the close of the Harvest the disciples had all met together,</span>
<span class="verse Acts_2_2" data-osis="Acts.2.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>when suddenly there came from the heavens a noise like  a strong wind rushing by; it filled the whole house in which they were sitting.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_2_3" data-osis="Acts.2.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>Then there appeared tongues of what seemed to be flame, separating, so that one settled on each of them;</span>
<span class="verse Acts_2_4" data-osis="Acts.2.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and began to speak with strange ‘tongues’ as the Spirit prompted their utterances.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Acts_2_5" data-osis="Acts.2.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>Now there were then staying in Jerusalem religious Jews from every country in the world;</span>
<span class="verse Acts_2_6" data-osis="Acts.2.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>and, when this sound was heard, numbers of people collected, in the greatest excitement, because each of them heard the disciples speaking in his own language.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_2_7" data-osis="Acts.2.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>They were utterly amazed, and kept asking in astonishment:</span>
</p>
<p>“What! Are not all these people who are speaking Galileans?
<span class="verse Acts_2_8" data-osis="Acts.2.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>Then how is it that we each of us hear them in our own  language?</span>
<span class="verse Acts_2_9" data-osis="Acts.2.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>Some of us are Parthians, some Medes, some Elamites; and some of us live in Mesopotamia, in Judea and Cappadocia, in Pontus and Roman Asia,</span>
<span class="verse Acts_2_10" data-osis="Acts.2.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>in Phrygia and Pamphylia, in Egypt and the districts of Libya adjoining Cyrene; some of us are visitors from Rome,</span>
<span class="verse Acts_2_11" data-osis="Acts.2.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>either Jews by birth or converts, and some are Cretans and Arabians — yet we all alike hear them speaking in our own tongues of the great things that God has done.”</span>
<span class="verse Acts_2_12" data-osis="Acts.2.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>They were all utterly amazed and bewildered.</span>
</p>
<p>“What does it mean?” they asked one another.
<span class="verse Acts_2_13" data-osis="Acts.2.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>But there were some who said with a sneer: “They have had too much new wine.”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Acts_2_14" data-osis="Acts.2.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>Then Peter, surrounded by the eleven other apostles, stood up, and, raising his voice, addressed the crowd. “People of Judea,” he began, “and all you who are staying in Jerusalem, let me tell you what this means. Mark well my words.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_2_15" data-osis="Acts.2.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>These people are not drunk, as you suppose; for it is only now nine in the morning! No!</span>
<span class="verse Acts_2_16" data-osis="Acts.2.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>This is what is spoken of in the prophet Joel —<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
<span class="verse Acts_2_17" data-osis="Acts.2.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>‘It will come about in the last days,’ God says,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘That I will pour out my Spirit on all humanity;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your sons and your daughters will become prophets,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your young men will see visions,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And your old men dream dreams;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
<span class="verse Acts_2_18" data-osis="Acts.2.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>Yes, even on the slaves — for they are mine — both men and women,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will in those days pour out my Spirit,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they will become prophets;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
<span class="verse Acts_2_19" data-osis="Acts.2.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>And I will show wonders in the heavens above,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And signs on the earth below —<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blood and fire and mist of smoke;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
<span class="verse Acts_2_20" data-osis="Acts.2.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>The sun will become darkness,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the moon blood-red,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the day of the Lord comes — that great and awful day.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
<span class="verse Acts_2_21" data-osis="Acts.2.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>Then will everyone who invokes the name of the Lord be saved.’<br /><br /></span>
<span class="verse Acts_2_22" data-osis="Acts.2.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>People of Israel, listen to what I am saying. Jesus of Nazareth, a man whose mission from God to you was proved by miracles, wonders, and signs, which God showed among you through him, as you know full well —</span>
<span class="verse Acts_2_23" data-osis="Acts.2.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>He, I say, in accordance with God’s definite plan and with his previous knowledge, was betrayed, and you, by the hands of lawless men, nailed him to a cross and put him to death.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_2_24" data-osis="Acts.2.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span>But God released him from the pangs of death and raised him to life, it being impossible for death to retain its hold on him.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_2_25" data-osis="Acts.2.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span>Indeed he was the one David was referring to when he said —<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘I have had the Lord ever before my eyes,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For he stands at my right hand, so that I should not be disquieted.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
<span class="verse Acts_2_26" data-osis="Acts.2.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span>Therefore my heart was cheered, and my tongue told its delight;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, even my body, too, will rest in hope;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
<span class="verse Acts_2_27" data-osis="Acts.2.27"><span class="verse-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span>For you will not abandon my soul to the place of death,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor surrender me, your holy one, to undergo corruption.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
<span class="verse Acts_2_28" data-osis="Acts.2.28"><span class="verse-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span>You have shown me the path to life,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will fill me with gladness in your presence.’<br /><br /></span>
<span class="verse Acts_2_29" data-osis="Acts.2.29"><span class="verse-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span>Friends, I can speak to you the more confidently about the patriarch David, because he is dead and buried, and his tomb is here among us to this very day.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_2_30" data-osis="Acts.2.30"><span class="verse-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span>David, then, prophet as he was, knowing that God ‘had solemnly sworn to him to set one of his descendants on his throne,’ looked into the future,</span>
<span class="verse Acts_2_31" data-osis="Acts.2.31"><span class="verse-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span>and referred to the resurrection of the Christ when he said that ‘he had not been abandoned to the place of death, nor had his body undergone corruption.’</span>
<span class="verse Acts_2_32" data-osis="Acts.2.32"><span class="verse-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span>It was this Jesus, whom God raised to life; and of that we are ourselves all witnesses.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_2_33" data-osis="Acts.2.33"><span class="verse-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span>And now that he has been exalted to the right hand of God, and has received from the Father the promised gift of the Holy Spirit, he has begun to pour out that gift, as you yourselves now see and hear.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_2_34" data-osis="Acts.2.34"><span class="verse-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span>It was not David who went up into heaven; for he himself says —<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘The Lord said to my master: “Sit on my right hand,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
<span class="verse Acts_2_35" data-osis="Acts.2.35"><span class="verse-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span>Until I put your enemies as a footstool under your feet.”’<br /><br /></span>
<span class="verse Acts_2_36" data-osis="Acts.2.36"><span class="verse-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span>So let the whole nation of Israel know beyond all doubt, that God has made him both Lord and Christ — this  Jesus whom you crucified.”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Acts_2_37" data-osis="Acts.2.37"><span class="verse-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span>When the people heard this, they were conscience-smitten, and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles: “Friends, what can we do?”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Acts_2_38" data-osis="Acts.2.38"><span class="verse-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span>“Repent,” answered Peter, “and be baptized every one of you in the faith of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins; and then you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_2_39" data-osis="Acts.2.39"><span class="verse-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span>For the promise is for you and for your children, and also for all those now far away, who may be called by the Lord our God.”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Acts_2_40" data-osis="Acts.2.40"><span class="verse-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span>Peter spoke to them for a long time using many other arguments and pleaded with them — “Save yourselves from the perverse spirit of this age.”</span>
<span class="verse Acts_2_41" data-osis="Acts.2.41"><span class="verse-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span>So those who accepted his teaching were baptized, and about three thousand people joined the disciples on that day alone.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_2_42" data-osis="Acts.2.42"><span class="verse-num v-42">42&nbsp;</span>They devoted themselves to the teaching of the apostles and to the Common life of the church, to the breaking of the bread and to the Prayers.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Acts_2_43" data-osis="Acts.2.43"><span class="verse-num v-43">43&nbsp;</span>A deep impression was made on everyone, and many wonders and signs were done at the hands of the apostles.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_2_44" data-osis="Acts.2.44"><span class="verse-num v-44">44&nbsp;</span>All who became believers in Christ held everything for the common use;</span>
<span class="verse Acts_2_45" data-osis="Acts.2.45"><span class="verse-num v-45">45&nbsp;</span>they sold their property and their goods, and shared the proceeds among them all, according to their individual needs.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_2_46" data-osis="Acts.2.46"><span class="verse-num v-46">46&nbsp;</span>Every day they devoted themselves to meeting together in the Temple Courts, and to the breaking of bread at their homes, while they partook of their food in simple-hearted gladness, praising God, and winning the goodwill of all the people.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_2_47" data-osis="Acts.2.47"><span class="verse-num v-47">47&nbsp;</span>And the Lord daily added to their company those who were in the path of salvation.</span>

<span class="verse Acts_21_1" data-osis="Acts.21.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>When we had torn ourselves away and had set sail, we ran before the wind to Cos; the next day we came to Rhodes, and from there to Patara,</span>
<span class="verse Acts_21_2" data-osis="Acts.21.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>where we found a ship crossing to Phoenicia, and went on board and set sail.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_21_3" data-osis="Acts.21.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>After sighting Cyprus and leaving it on the left, we sailed to Syria, and put into Tyre, where the ship was to discharge her cargo.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_21_4" data-osis="Acts.21.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>There we found the disciples and stayed a week with them. Speaking under the influence of the Spirit, they warned Paul not to set foot in Jerusalem.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_21_5" data-osis="Acts.21.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>However, when we had come to the end of our visit, we went on our way, all the disciples with their wives and children escorting us out of the city. We knelt down on the beach, and prayed,</span>
<span class="verse Acts_21_6" data-osis="Acts.21.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>and then said good-bye to one another; after which we went on board, and they returned home.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_21_7" data-osis="Acts.21.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>After we had made the run from Tyre, we landed at Ptolemais, and exchanged greetings with the Brethren there, and spent a day with them.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_21_8" data-osis="Acts.21.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>The next day we left, and reached Caesarea, where we went to the house of Philip, the Missionary, who was one of &lsquo;the Seven,&rsquo; and stayed with him.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_21_9" data-osis="Acts.21.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>He had four unmarried daughters, who had the gift of prophecy.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_21_10" data-osis="Acts.21.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>During our visit, which lasted several days, a Prophet, named Agabus, came down from Judea.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_21_11" data-osis="Acts.21.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>He came to see us, and, taking Paul&rsquo;s girdle, and binding his own feet and hands with it, said: &ldquo;This is what the Holy Spirit says &mdash; &lsquo;The man to whom this girdle belongs will be bound like this at Jerusalem by the Jews, and they will give him up to the Gentiles&rsquo;.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Acts_21_12" data-osis="Acts.21.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>When we heard that, we and the people of the place began to entreat Paul not to go up to Jerusalem.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_21_13" data-osis="Acts.21.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>It was then that Paul made the reply: &ldquo;Why are you weeping and breaking my heart like this? For my part, I am ready not only to be bound, but even to suffer death at Jerusalem for the Name of the Lord Jesus.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Acts_21_14" data-osis="Acts.21.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>So, as he would not be persuaded, we said no more to him, only adding &mdash; &ldquo;The Lord&rsquo;s will be done.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Acts_21_15" data-osis="Acts.21.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>At the end of our visit, we made our preparations, and started on our way up to Jerusalem.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_21_16" data-osis="Acts.21.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>Some of the disciples from Caesarea went with us, and brought Mnason with them, a Cypriot disciple of long standing, with whom we were to stay.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_21_17" data-osis="Acts.21.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>On our arrival at Jerusalem, the Brethren there gave us a hearty welcome;</span>
<span class="verse Acts_21_18" data-osis="Acts.21.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>and the next day Paul went with us to see James, and all the Officers of the Church were present.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_21_19" data-osis="Acts.21.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>After greeting them, Paul related in detail all that God had done among the Gentiles through his efforts;</span>
<span class="verse Acts_21_20" data-osis="Acts.21.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>and, when they had heard it, they began praising God, and said to Paul: &ldquo;You see, Brother, that the Jews who have become believers in Christ may be numbered by tens of thousands, and they are all naturally earnest in upholding the Jewish Law.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_21_21" data-osis="Acts.21.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>Now they have heard it said about you, that you teach all Jews in foreign countries to forsake Moses, for you tell them not to circumcise their children or even to observe Jewish customs.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_21_22" data-osis="Acts.21.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>Well now, as they are certain to hear of your arrival, do what we are going to suggest.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_21_23" data-osis="Acts.21.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>We have four men here, who have of their own accord put themselves under a vow.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_21_24" data-osis="Acts.21.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span>Join these men, share their purification, and bear their expenses, so that they may shave their heads; and then all will see that there is no truth in what they have been told about you, but that, on the contrary, you yourself rule your life in obedience to the Jewish Law.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_21_25" data-osis="Acts.21.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span>As to the Gentiles who have become believers in Christ, we have sent our decision that they should avoid food offered to idols, and blood, and the flesh of strangled animals, and impurity.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Acts_21_26" data-osis="Acts.21.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span>On this, Paul joined the men, and the next day shared their purification, and went into the Temple, and gave notice of the expiration of the period of purification when the usual offering should have been made on behalf of each of them.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_21_27" data-osis="Acts.21.27"><span class="verse-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span>But, just as the seven days were drawing to a close, the Jews from Roman Asia caught sight of Paul in the Temple, and caused great excitement among all the people present, by seizing Paul and shouting:</span>
<span class="verse Acts_21_28" data-osis="Acts.21.28"><span class="verse-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Men of Israel! help! This is the man who teaches every one everywhere against our People, our Law, and this Place; and, what is more, he has actually brought Greeks into the Temple and defiled this sacred place.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Acts_21_29" data-osis="Acts.21.29"><span class="verse-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span>(For they had previously seen Trophimus the Ephesian in Paul&rsquo;s company in the city, and were under the belief that Paul had taken him into the Temple.)</span>
<span class="verse Acts_21_30" data-osis="Acts.21.30"><span class="verse-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span>The whole city was stirred, and the people quickly collected, seized Paul, and dragged him out of the Temple, when the doors were immediately shut.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_21_31" data-osis="Acts.21.31"><span class="verse-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span>They were bent upon killing him, when it was reported to the Officer commanding the garrison, that all Jerusalem was in commotion.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_21_32" data-osis="Acts.21.32"><span class="verse-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span>He instantly got together some officers and men, and charged down upon the crowd, who, when they saw the Commanding Officer and his men, stopped beating Paul.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_21_33" data-osis="Acts.21.33"><span class="verse-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span>Then he went up to Paul, arrested him, ordered him to be doubly chained, and proceeded to inquire who he was, and what he had been doing.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_21_34" data-osis="Acts.21.34"><span class="verse-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span>Some of the crowd said one thing, and some another; and, as he could get no definite reply on account of the uproar, he ordered Paul to be taken into the barracks.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_21_35" data-osis="Acts.21.35"><span class="verse-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span>When Paul reached the steps, he was actually being carried by the soldiers, owing to the violence of the mob;</span>
<span class="verse Acts_21_36" data-osis="Acts.21.36"><span class="verse-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span>for the people were following in a mass, shouting out: &ldquo;Kill him!&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Acts_21_37" data-osis="Acts.21.37"><span class="verse-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span>Just as he was about to be taken into the Fort, Paul said to the Commanding Officer: &ldquo;May I speak to you?&rdquo; &ldquo;Do you know Greek?&rdquo; asked the Commanding Officer.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_21_38" data-osis="Acts.21.38"><span class="verse-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Are not you, then, the Egyptian who some time ago raised an insurrection and led the four thousand Bandits out into the Wilderness?&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Acts_21_39" data-osis="Acts.21.39"><span class="verse-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Paul, &ldquo;I am a Jew of Tarsus in Cilicia, a citizen of a city of some note; and I beg you to give me permission to speak to the people.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Acts_21_40" data-osis="Acts.21.40"><span class="verse-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span>The Commanding Officer gave his permission, and Paul, standing on the steps, made signs with his hand to the people, and, when comparative silence had been obtained, he spoke to them in Hebrew, as follows:</span>

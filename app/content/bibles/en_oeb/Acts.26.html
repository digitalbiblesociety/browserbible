<p>
<span class="verse Acts_26_1" data-osis="Acts.26.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>Turning to Paul, Agrippa said: “You are at liberty to speak for yourself.” Then Paul stretched out his hand and began his defense.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_26_2" data-osis="Acts.26.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>“I have been congratulating myself, King Agrippa,” he said, “that it is before you that I have to make my defense today, with regard to all the charges brought against me by my own people,</span>
<span class="verse Acts_26_3" data-osis="Acts.26.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>especially as you are so well-versed in all the customs and questions of the Jewish world. I beg you therefore to give me a patient hearing.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_26_4" data-osis="Acts.26.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>My life, then, from youth upwards, was passed, from the very first, among my own nation, and in Jerusalem, and is within the knowledge of all Jews;</span>
<span class="verse Acts_26_5" data-osis="Acts.26.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>and they have always known — if they choose to give evidence — that, in accordance with the very strictest form of our religion, I lived a true Pharisee.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_26_6" data-osis="Acts.26.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>Even now, it is because of my hope in the promise given by God to our ancestors that I stand here on my trial —</span>
<span class="verse Acts_26_7" data-osis="Acts.26.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>A promise which our twelve tribes, by earnest service night and day, hope to see fulfilled. It is for this hope, your Majesty, that I am accused — and by Jews themselves!</span>
<span class="verse Acts_26_8" data-osis="Acts.26.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>Why do you all hold it incredible that God should raise the dead?</span>
<span class="verse Acts_26_9" data-osis="Acts.26.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>I myself, it is true, once thought it my duty to oppose in every way the name of Jesus of Nazareth;</span>
<span class="verse Acts_26_10" data-osis="Acts.26.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>and I actually did so at Jerusalem. Acting on the authority of the chief priests, I myself threw many of the people of Christ into prison, and, when it was proposed to put them to death, I gave my vote for it.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_26_11" data-osis="Acts.26.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>Time after time, in every synagogue, I tried by punishments to force them to blaspheme. So frantic was I against them, that I pursued them even to towns beyond our borders.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_26_12" data-osis="Acts.26.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>It was while I was traveling to Damascus on an errand of this kind, entrusted with full powers by the chief priests,</span>
<span class="verse Acts_26_13" data-osis="Acts.26.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>that at midday, your Majesty, I saw right in my path, coming from the heavens, a light brighter than the glare of the sun, which shone all around me and those traveling with me.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_26_14" data-osis="Acts.26.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>We all fell to the ground, and then I heard a voice saying to me in Hebrew — <span class="woc">‘Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me? By kicking against the goad you are punishing yourself.’</span></span>
<span class="verse Acts_26_15" data-osis="Acts.26.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>‘Who are you, Lord?’ I asked. And the Lord said: <span class="woc">“I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting;</span></span>
<span class="verse Acts_26_16" data-osis="Acts.26.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">but get up and stand upright; for I have appeared to you in order to appoint you a servant and a witness of those revelations of me which you have already had, and of those in which I will yet appear to you,</span></span>
<span class="verse Acts_26_17" data-osis="Acts.26.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">since I am choosing you out from your own people and from the Gentiles, to whom I now send you,</span></span>
<span class="verse Acts_26_18" data-osis="Acts.26.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">to open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan to God; so that they may receive pardon for their sins, and a place among those who have become God’s people, by faith in me.’</span></span>
<span class="verse Acts_26_19" data-osis="Acts.26.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>After that, King Agrippa, I did not fail to obey the heavenly vision;</span>
<span class="verse Acts_26_20" data-osis="Acts.26.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>on the contrary, first to those at Damascus and Jerusalem, and then through the whole of Judea, and to the Gentiles as well, I began to preach repentance and conversion to God, and a life befitting that repentance.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_26_21" data-osis="Acts.26.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>This is why some men seized me in the Temple, and made attempts on my life.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_26_22" data-osis="Acts.26.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>However I have received help from God to this very day, and so stand here, and bear my testimony to high and low alike — without adding a word to what the prophets, as well as Moses, declared should happen —</span>
<span class="verse Acts_26_23" data-osis="Acts.26.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>That the Christ must suffer, and that, by rising from the dead, he was destined to be the first to bring news of light, not only to our nation, but also to the Gentiles.”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Acts_26_24" data-osis="Acts.26.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span>While Paul was making this defense, Festus called out loudly: “You are mad, Paul; your great learning is driving you mad.”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Acts_26_25" data-osis="Acts.26.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span>“I am not mad, your Excellency,” he replied; “on the contrary, the statements that I am making are true and sober.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_26_26" data-osis="Acts.26.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span>Indeed, the king knows about these matters, so I speak before him without constraint. I am sure that there is nothing whatever of what I have been telling him that has escaped his attention; for all this has not been done in a corner.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_26_27" data-osis="Acts.26.27"><span class="verse-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span>King Agrippa, do you believe the prophets? I know you do.”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Acts_26_28" data-osis="Acts.26.28"><span class="verse-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span>But Agrippa said to Paul: “You are soon trying to make a Christian of me!”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Acts_26_29" data-osis="Acts.26.29"><span class="verse-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span>“Whether it is soon or late,” answered Paul, “I pray to God that not only you, but all who are listening to me, might today become just what I am myself — except for these chains!”</span>
<span class="verse Acts_26_30" data-osis="Acts.26.30"><span class="verse-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span>Then the king rose, with the Governor and Bernice and those who had been sitting with them,</span>
<span class="verse Acts_26_31" data-osis="Acts.26.31"><span class="verse-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span>and, after retiring, discussed the case among themselves. “There is nothing,” they said, “deserving death or imprisonment in this man’s conduct”;</span>
<span class="verse Acts_26_32" data-osis="Acts.26.32"><span class="verse-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span>and, speaking to Festus, Agrippa added: “The man might have been discharged, if he had not appealed to the Emperor.”</span>

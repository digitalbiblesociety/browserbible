<h2 class="chapter-num">4</h2>
<p>
<span class="verse Acts_4_1" data-osis="Acts.4.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>While Peter and John were still speaking to the people, the chief priest, with the officer in charge at the Temple and the Sadducees, came up to them,</span>
<span class="verse Acts_4_2" data-osis="Acts.4.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>much annoyed because they were teaching the people, and because, through Jesus, they were preaching the resurrection from the dead.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_4_3" data-osis="Acts.4.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>They arrested the apostles and, as it was already evening, had them placed in custody until the next day.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_4_4" data-osis="Acts.4.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>Many, however, of those who had heard the apostles’ message became believers in Christ, the number of the men alone amounting to about five thousand.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_4_5" data-osis="Acts.4.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>The next day, a meeting of the leaders of the people, the councillors, and the teachers of the law was held in Jerusalem.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_4_6" data-osis="Acts.4.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>There were present Annas the high priest, Caiaphas, John, Alexander, and all who were of High-Priestly rank.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_4_7" data-osis="Acts.4.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>They had Peter and John brought before them, and questioned them.</span>
</p>
<p>“By what power,” they asked, “Or in whose name have men like you done this thing?”
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Acts_4_8" data-osis="Acts.4.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>Then, Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said: “Leaders of the people and councillors,</span>
<span class="verse Acts_4_9" data-osis="Acts.4.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>since we are on our trial today for a kind act done to a helpless man, and are asked in what way the man here before you has been cured,</span>
<span class="verse Acts_4_10" data-osis="Acts.4.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>let me tell you all and all the people of Israel, that it is by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified and whom God raised from the dead — it is, I say, by his name that this man stands here before you lame no longer.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_4_11" data-osis="Acts.4.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>Jesus is ‘the stone which, scorned by you the builders, has yet become the corner stone.’</span>
<span class="verse Acts_4_12" data-osis="Acts.4.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>And salvation is in him alone; for there is no other name in the whole world, given to people, to which we must look for our salvation.”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Acts_4_13" data-osis="Acts.4.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>When the Council saw how boldly Peter and John spoke, and found that they were uneducated men of humble station, they were surprised, and realized that they had been companions of Jesus.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_4_14" data-osis="Acts.4.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>But, when they looked at the man who had been healed, standing there with them, they had nothing to say.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_4_15" data-osis="Acts.4.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>So they ordered them out of court, and then began consulting together.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Acts_4_16" data-osis="Acts.4.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>“What are we to do to these men?” they asked one another. “That a remarkable sign has been given through them is obvious to everyone living in Jerusalem, and we cannot deny it.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_4_17" data-osis="Acts.4.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>But, to prevent this thing from spreading further among the people, let us warn them not to speak in this name any more to anyone whatever.”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Acts_4_18" data-osis="Acts.4.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>So they called the apostles in, and ordered them not to speak or teach in the name of Jesus.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Acts_4_19" data-osis="Acts.4.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>But Peter and John replied: “Whether it is right, in the sight of God, to listen to you rather than to him —</span>
<span class="verse Acts_4_20" data-osis="Acts.4.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>judge for yourselves, for we cannot help speaking of what we have seen and heard.”</span>
<span class="verse Acts_4_21" data-osis="Acts.4.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>However, after further warnings, the Council set them at liberty, not seeing any safe way of punishing them, because of the people, for they were all praising God for what had occurred;</span>
<span class="verse Acts_4_22" data-osis="Acts.4.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>for the man who was the subject of this miraculous cure was more than forty years old.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_4_23" data-osis="Acts.4.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>After they had been set at liberty, the apostles went to their friends and told them what the chief priests and the councillors had said to them.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_4_24" data-osis="Acts.4.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span>All who heard their story, moved by a common impulse, raised their voices to God in prayer:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Sovereign Lord, it is you who has ‘made the heavens, the earth, the sea, and everything that is in them,’</span>
<span class="verse Acts_4_25" data-osis="Acts.4.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span>And who, by the lips of our ancestor, your servant David, who spoke under the influence of the Holy Spirit, have said —<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘Why did the nations rage,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the peoples form vain designs?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
<span class="verse Acts_4_26" data-osis="Acts.4.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span>The kings of the earth set their array,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And its rulers gathered together,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Against the Lord and against his Christ.’<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
<span class="verse Acts_4_27" data-osis="Acts.4.27"><span class="verse-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span>There have indeed gathered together in this city against your holy servant Jesus, whom you has consecrated the Christ, not Herod and Pontius Pilate only, but the nations and the people of Israel besides —</span>
<span class="verse Acts_4_28" data-osis="Acts.4.28"><span class="verse-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span>Yet only to do what you, by your power and of your own will, did long ago destine to be done.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_4_29" data-osis="Acts.4.29"><span class="verse-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span>Now, therefore, Lord, mark their threats, and enable your servants, with all fearlessness, to tell your message,</span>
<span class="verse Acts_4_30" data-osis="Acts.4.30"><span class="verse-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span>while you stretch out your hand to heal, and cause signs and wonders to take place through the name of your holy servant Jesus.”<br /><br /></span>
<span class="verse Acts_4_31" data-osis="Acts.4.31"><span class="verse-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span>When their prayer was ended, the place in which they were assembled was shaken; and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and began to tell God’s message fearlessly.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_4_32" data-osis="Acts.4.32"><span class="verse-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span>The whole body of those who had become believers in Christ were of one heart and mind. Not one of them claimed any of his goods as his own, but everything was held for the common use.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_4_33" data-osis="Acts.4.33"><span class="verse-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span>The apostles continued with great power to bear their testimony to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and God’s blessing rested on them all abundantly.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_4_34" data-osis="Acts.4.34"><span class="verse-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span>Nor was there anyone in need among them, for all who were owners of land or houses sold them, and brought the proceeds of the sales</span>
<span class="verse Acts_4_35" data-osis="Acts.4.35"><span class="verse-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span>And laid them at the apostles’ feet; and then everyone received a share in proportion to his wants.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_4_36" data-osis="Acts.4.36"><span class="verse-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span>A Levite of Cyprian birth, named Joseph, (who had received from the apostles the additional name of ‘Barnabas’ — which means ‘The Consoler,’)</span>
<span class="verse Acts_4_37" data-osis="Acts.4.37"><span class="verse-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span>Sold a farm that belonged to him, and brought the money and laid it at the apostles’ feet.</span>

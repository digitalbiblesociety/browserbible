<h2 class="chapter-num">9</h2>
<p>
<span class="verse Acts_9_1" data-osis="Acts.9.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>Meanwhile Saul, still breathing murderous threats against the disciples of the Lord, went to the high priest,</span>
<span class="verse Acts_9_2" data-osis="Acts.9.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>and asked him to give him letters to the Jewish congregations at Damascus, authorizing him, if he found there any supporters of the cause, whether men or women, to have them put in chains and brought to Jerusalem.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Acts_9_3" data-osis="Acts.9.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>While on his journey, as he was nearing Damascus, suddenly a light from the heavens flashed around him.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_9_4" data-osis="Acts.9.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>He fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to him — <span class="woc">“Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?”</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Acts_9_5" data-osis="Acts.9.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>“Who are you, Lord?” he asked.</span>
</p>
<p><span class="woc">“I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting,”</span>the voice answered;
<span class="verse Acts_9_6" data-osis="Acts.9.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">“Yet stand up and go into the city, and you will be told what you must do.”</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Acts_9_7" data-osis="Acts.9.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>The men traveling with Saul were meanwhile standing speechless; they heard the sound of the voice, but saw no one.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_9_8" data-osis="Acts.9.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>When Saul got up from the ground, though his eyes were open, he could see nothing. So his men led him by the hand, and brought him into Damascus;</span>
<span class="verse Acts_9_9" data-osis="Acts.9.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>and for three days he was unable to see, and took nothing either to eat or to drink.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_9_10" data-osis="Acts.9.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>Now there was at Damascus a disciple named Ananias, to whom, in a vision, the Lord said: <span class="woc">“Ananias.”</span></span>
</p>
<p>“Yes, Lord,” he answered.
<span class="verse Acts_9_11" data-osis="Acts.9.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">“Go at once,”</span>said the Lord, <span class="woc">“to the ‘Straight Street’, and ask at Judas’s house for a man named Saul, from Tarsus. He is at this moment praying,</span></span>
<span class="verse Acts_9_12" data-osis="Acts.9.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">and he has seen, in a vision, a man named Ananias coming in and placing his hands on him, so that he may recover his sight.”</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Acts_9_13" data-osis="Acts.9.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>“Lord,” exclaimed Ananias, “I have heard from many people about this man — how much harm he has done at Jerusalem to your people there.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_9_14" data-osis="Acts.9.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>And, here, too, he holds authority from the chief priests to put in chains all those who invoke your name.”</span>
<span class="verse Acts_9_15" data-osis="Acts.9.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>But the Lord said to him: <span class="woc">“Go, for this man is my chosen instrument to uphold my name before the Gentiles and their kings, and the people of Israel.</span></span>
<span class="verse Acts_9_16" data-osis="Acts.9.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">I will myself show him all that he has to suffer for my name.”</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Acts_9_17" data-osis="Acts.9.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>So Ananias went, entered the house, and, placing his hands on Saul, said: “Saul, my brother, I have been sent by the Lord — by Jesus, who appeared to you on your way here — so that you may recover your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit.”</span>
<span class="verse Acts_9_18" data-osis="Acts.9.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>Instantly it seemed as if a film fell from Saul’s eyes, and his sight was restored. Then he got up and was baptized,</span>
<span class="verse Acts_9_19" data-osis="Acts.9.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>and, after he had taken food, he felt his strength return.</span>
</p>
<p>Saul stayed for some days with the disciples who were at Damascus,
<span class="verse Acts_9_20" data-osis="Acts.9.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>and at once began in the Synagogues to proclaim Jesus as the Son of God.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_9_21" data-osis="Acts.9.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>All who heard him were amazed.</span>
</p>
<p>“Is not this,” they asked, “the man who worked havoc in Jerusalem among those that invoke this name, and who had also come here for the express purpose of having such persons put in chains and taken before the chief priests?”
<span class="verse Acts_9_22" data-osis="Acts.9.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>Saul’s influence, however, kept steadily increasing, and he confounded the Jewish people who lived in Damascus by the proofs that he gave that Jesus was the Christ.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Acts_9_23" data-osis="Acts.9.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>After some time some of them laid a plot to kill Saul,</span>
<span class="verse Acts_9_24" data-osis="Acts.9.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span>but it became known to him. They even watched the gates day and night, to kill him;</span>
<span class="verse Acts_9_25" data-osis="Acts.9.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span>but his disciples let him down by night through an opening in the wall, lowering him in a basket.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Acts_9_26" data-osis="Acts.9.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span>On his arrival in Jerusalem, Saul attempted to join the disciples, but they were all afraid of him, as they did not believe that he was really a disciple.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_9_27" data-osis="Acts.9.27"><span class="verse-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span>Barnabas, however, taking him by the hand, brought him to the apostles, and told them the whole story of how Saul on his journey had seen the Lord, and how the Lord had talked to him, and how in Damascus he had spoken out fearlessly in the name of Jesus.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_9_28" data-osis="Acts.9.28"><span class="verse-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span>After that, Saul remained in Jerusalem, in close intercourse with the apostles; and he spoke fearlessly in the name of the Lord,</span>
<span class="verse Acts_9_29" data-osis="Acts.9.29"><span class="verse-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span>talking and arguing with the Jews of foreign birth, who, however, made attempts to kill him.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_9_30" data-osis="Acts.9.30"><span class="verse-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span>But, when the followers found this out, they took him down to Caesarea, and sent him on his way to Tarsus.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_9_31" data-osis="Acts.9.31"><span class="verse-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span>And so it came about that the church, throughout Judea, Galilee, and Samaria, enjoyed peace and became firmly established; and, ordering its life by respect for the Lord and the help of the Holy Spirit, it increased in numbers.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_9_32" data-osis="Acts.9.32"><span class="verse-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span>Peter, while traveling from place to place throughout the country, went down to visit the people of Christ living at Lydda.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_9_33" data-osis="Acts.9.33"><span class="verse-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span>There he found a man named Aeneas, who had been bedridden for eight years with paralysis.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_9_34" data-osis="Acts.9.34"><span class="verse-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span>“Aeneas,” Peter said to him, “Jesus Christ cures you. Get up, and make your bed.” Aeneas got up at once;</span>
<span class="verse Acts_9_35" data-osis="Acts.9.35"><span class="verse-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span>and all the inhabitants of Lydda and of the Plain of Sharon saw him, and came over to the Lord’s side.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_9_36" data-osis="Acts.9.36"><span class="verse-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span>At Jaffa there lived a disciple whose name was Tabitha, which is in Greek ‘Dorcas’ — a Gazelle. Her life was spent in doing kind and charitable actions.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_9_37" data-osis="Acts.9.37"><span class="verse-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span>Just at that time she was taken ill, and died; and they had washed her body and laid it out in an upstairs room.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_9_38" data-osis="Acts.9.38"><span class="verse-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span>Jaffa was near Lydda, and the disciples, having heard that Peter was at Lydda, sent two men with the request that he come to them without delay.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_9_39" data-osis="Acts.9.39"><span class="verse-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span>Peter returned with them at once. On his arrival, he was taken upstairs, and all the widows came around him in tears, showing the coats and other clothing which Dorcas had made while she was among them.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_9_40" data-osis="Acts.9.40"><span class="verse-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span>But Peter sent everybody out of the room, and knelt down and prayed. Then, turning to the body, he said: “Tabitha! Stand up.”</span>
</p>
<p>She opened her eyes, and, seeing Peter, sat up.
<span class="verse Acts_9_41" data-osis="Acts.9.41"><span class="verse-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span>Giving her his hand, Peter raised her up, and, calling in the widows and others of Christ’s people, presented her to them alive.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_9_42" data-osis="Acts.9.42"><span class="verse-num v-42">42&nbsp;</span>This became known all through Jaffa, and numbers of people came to believe in the Lord.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_9_43" data-osis="Acts.9.43"><span class="verse-num v-43">43&nbsp;</span>And Peter stayed some days at Jaffa with a tanner named Simon.</span>

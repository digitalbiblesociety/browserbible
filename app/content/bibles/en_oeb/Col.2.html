<span class="verse" data-osis="Col.2.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>I want you to know in how great a struggle I am engaged for you and for Christ&rsquo;s People at Laodicea, and for all who have not yet seen me;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Col.2.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>in the hope that they, being bound to one another by love, and keeping in view the full blessedness of a firm conviction, may be encouraged to strive for a perfect knowledge of God&rsquo;s hidden Truth,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Col.2.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>even Christ himself, in whom all treasures of wisdom and knowledge lie hidden.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Col.2.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>I say this to prevent any one from deceiving you by plausible arguments.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Col.2.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>It is true that I am not with you in person, but I am with you in spirit, and am glad to see the good order and the unbroken front resulting from your faith in Christ.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Col.2.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>Since, therefore, you have received Jesus, the Christ, as your Lord, live your lives in union with him &mdash;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Col.2.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>Rooted in him, building up your characters through union with him, growing stronger through your faith, as you were taught, overflowing with faith and thanksgiving.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Col.2.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>Take care there is not some one who will carry you away by his &lsquo;philosophy&rsquo; &mdash; a hollow sham! &mdash; following, as it does, mere human traditions, and dealing with puerile questions of this world, and not with Christ.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Col.2.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>For in Christ the Godhead in all its fulness dwells incarnate;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Col.2.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>and, by your union with him, you also are filled with it. He is the Head of all Archangels and Powers of Heaven.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Col.2.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>By your union with him you received a circumcision that was not performed by human hands, when you threw off the tyranny of the earthly body, and received the circumcision of the Christ.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Col.2.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>For in baptism you were buried with Christ; and in baptism you were also raised to Life with him, through your faith in the omnipotence of God, who raised him from the dead.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Col.2.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>And to you, who once were &lsquo;dead,&rsquo; by reason of your sins and your uncircumcised nature &mdash; to you God gave Life in giving life to Christ! He pardoned all our sins!</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Col.2.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>He canceled the bond which stood against us &mdash; the bond that consisted of ordinances &mdash; and which was directly hostile to us! He has taken it out of our way by nailing it to the cross!</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Col.2.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>He rid himself of all the Powers of Evil, and held them up to open contempt, when he celebrated his triumph over them on the cross!</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Col.2.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span>Do not, then, allow any one to take you to task on questions of eating or drinking, or in the matter of annual or monthly or weekly festivals.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Col.2.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span>These things are only the shadow of what is to come; the substance is in the Christ.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Col.2.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span>Do not let any one defraud you of the reality by affecting delight in so-called &lsquo;humility&rsquo; and angel-worship. Such a man busies himself with his visions, and without reason is rendered conceited by his merely human intellect.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Col.2.19"><span class="verse-num">19&nbsp;</span>He fails to maintain union with the Head, to whom it is due that the whole body, nourished and knit together by the contact and Keynesian of every part, grows with a divine growth.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Col.2.20"><span class="verse-num">20&nbsp;</span>Since, with Christ, you became dead to the puerile teaching of this world, why do you submit, as though your life were still that of the world,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Col.2.21"><span class="verse-num">21&nbsp;</span>to such ordinances as &lsquo;Do not handle, or taste, or touch&rsquo;?</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Col.2.22"><span class="verse-num">22&nbsp;</span>For all the things referred to in them cease to exist when used. You are following mere human directions and instructions.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Col.2.23"><span class="verse-num">23&nbsp;</span>Such prohibitions appear reasonable where there is a desire for self-imposed service, and so-called &lsquo;humility,&rsquo; and harsh treatment of the body, but are of no real value against the indulgence of our earthly nature.</span>

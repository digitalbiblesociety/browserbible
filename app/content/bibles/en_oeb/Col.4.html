<span class="verse" data-osis="Col.4.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>Masters, do what is right and fair by your slaves, for you know that you also have a Master &mdash; in Heaven.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Col.4.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>Devote yourselves to prayer. Give your whole mind to it, and also offer thanksgiving;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Col.4.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>and at the same time pray for us, that God may give us an opening for our Message, so that we may speak of the truths hidden in the Christ &mdash; the truths for which I am in chains!</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Col.4.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>Then I shall make them known, as I ought to do.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Col.4.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>Show tact in your behaviour to the outside world, making the most of every opportunity.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Col.4.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>Let your conversation always be kindly, and seasoned, as it were, with salt; that you may know in each case what answer you ought to give.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Col.4.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>Our dear Brother, Tychicus, will tell you all about me. He is a faithful minister, and a fellow-servant in the Master&rsquo;s cause.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Col.4.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>I send him to you expressly that you may learn our circumstances, and that he may give you encouragement.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Col.4.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>With him will be Onesimus, our dear faithful Brother, who is one of yourselves. They will tell you all that is going on here.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Col.4.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>My fellow-prisoner, Aristarchus, sends you his greeting, and Barnabas&rsquo;s cousin, Mark, sends his. (You have received directions about him. If he comes to you, make him welcome.)</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Col.4.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>Joshua, who is called Justus, also sends his greeting. These are the only converts from Judaism who have worked with me for the kingdom of God; I have found them a great comfort.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Col.4.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>Epaphras, who is one of yourselves, sends you his greeting. He is a servant of Christ Jesus, and is always most earnest in your behalf in his prayers, praying that you may stand firm, with a matured faith and with a sure conviction of all that is in accordance with God&rsquo;s will.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Col.4.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>I can bear testimony to the deep interest he takes in you, as well as in the Brethren at Laodicea and at Hierapolis.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Col.4.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>Luke, our dear doctor, sends you his greeting, and Demas sends his.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Col.4.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>Give my greeting to the Brethren at Laodicea, and to Nymphe, and to the Church that meets at her house.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Col.4.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span>And when this letter has been read to you, see that it is also read before the Church at Laodicea, and that you yourselves read the letter which will be forwarded from there.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Col.4.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span>Give this message to Archippus &mdash; &lsquo;Take care to discharge to the best of your ability the office to which you were appointed in the Master&rsquo;s Cause.&rsquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Col.4.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span>I, Paul, add this greeting in my own handwriting. Remember these chains of mine. God&rsquo;s blessing be with you.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Eph.3.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>For this reason I, Paul, the prisoner of Jesus, the Christ, for the sake of you Gentiles &mdash;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Eph.3.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>For you have heard, I suppose, of the responsible charge with which God entrusted me for your benefit,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Eph.3.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>and also that it was by direct revelation that the hidden purpose of God was made known to me, as I have already briefly told you.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Eph.3.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>And, by reading what I have written, you will be able to judge how far I understand this hidden purpose of God in Christ.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Eph.3.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>In former generations it was not made known to mankind, as fully as it has now been revealed by the Spirit to the Apostles and Prophets among Christ&rsquo;s People &mdash;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Eph.3.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>That, by union with Christ Jesus and through the Good News, the Gentiles are co-heirs with us and members of one Body, and that they share with us in God&rsquo;s Promise.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Eph.3.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>Of this Good News I became a minister, in virtue of the charge with which God entrusted me in the exercise of his power &mdash;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Eph.3.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>Yes, to me, who am less than the least of all Christ&rsquo;s People, was this charge entrusted! &mdash; to tell the Gentiles the Good News of the boundless wealth to be found in the Christ,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Eph.3.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>and to make clear what is God&rsquo;s way of working out that hidden purpose which from the first has been concealed in the mind of the Creator of all things;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Eph.3.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>so that now to the Archangels and to all the Powers on high should be made known, through the Church, the all-embracing wisdom of God,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Eph.3.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>in accordance with that purpose which runs through all the ages and which he has now accomplished in Jesus, the Christ, our Master.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Eph.3.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>And in union with him, and through our trust in him, we find courage to approach God with confidence.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Eph.3.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>Therefore I beg you not to be disheartened at the sufferings that I am undergoing for your sakes; for they redound to your honour.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Eph.3.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>For this reason, then, I kneel before the Father &mdash;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Eph.3.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>From whom all &lsquo;fatherhood&rsquo; in Heaven and on earth derives its name &mdash;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Eph.3.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span>And pray that, in proportion to the wealth of his glory, he will strengthen you with his power by breathing his Spirit into your inmost soul,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Eph.3.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span>so that the Christ, through your faith, may make his home within your hearts in love; And I pray that you, now firmly rooted and established, may, with all Christ&rsquo;s People,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Eph.3.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span>have the power to comprehend in all its width and length and height and depth,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Eph.3.19"><span class="verse-num">19&nbsp;</span>and to understand &mdash; though it surpasses all understanding &mdash; the love of the Christ; and so be filled to the full with God himself.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Eph.3.20"><span class="verse-num">20&nbsp;</span>To him who, through his power which is at work within us, is able to do far more than anything that we can ask or conceive &mdash;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Eph.3.21"><span class="verse-num">21&nbsp;</span>To him be all glory through the Church and through Christ Jesus, for all generations, age after age. Amen.</span>

<span class="verse Eph_5_1" data-osis="Eph.5.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>Therefore imitate God, as his dear children,</span>
<span class="verse Eph_5_2" data-osis="Eph.5.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>and live a life of love, following the example of the Christ, who loved you and gave himself for you as &lsquo;an offering and a sacrifice to God, that should be fragrant and acceptable.&rsquo;</span>
<span class="verse Eph_5_3" data-osis="Eph.5.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>As for unchastity and every kind of impurity, or greed, do not let them even be mentioned among you, as befits Christ&rsquo;s People,</span>
<span class="verse Eph_5_4" data-osis="Eph.5.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>nor shameful conduct, nor foolish talk or jesting, for they are wholly out of place among you; but rather thanksgiving.</span>
<span class="verse Eph_5_5" data-osis="Eph.5.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>For of this you may be sure &mdash; that no one who is unchaste or impure or greedy of gain (for to be greedy of gain is idolatry) has any place awaiting him in the kingdom of the Christ and God.</span>
<span class="verse Eph_5_6" data-osis="Eph.5.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>Do not let any one deceive you with specious arguments. Those are the sins that bring down the Wrath of God upon the disobedient.</span>
<span class="verse Eph_5_7" data-osis="Eph.5.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>Therefore have nothing to do with such people.</span>
<span class="verse Eph_5_8" data-osis="Eph.5.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>For, although you were once in Darkness, now, by your union with the Lord, you are in the Light. Live as &lsquo;Children of Light&rsquo;- -</span>
<span class="verse Eph_5_9" data-osis="Eph.5.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>For the outcome of life in the Light may be seen in every form of goodness, righteousness, and sincerity &mdash;</span>
<span class="verse Eph_5_10" data-osis="Eph.5.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>Always trying to find out what is pleasing to the Lord.</span>
<span class="verse Eph_5_11" data-osis="Eph.5.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>Take no part in deeds of Darkness, from which no good can come; on the contrary, expose them.</span>
<span class="verse Eph_5_12" data-osis="Eph.5.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>It is degrading even to speak of the things continually done by them in secret.</span>
<span class="verse Eph_5_13" data-osis="Eph.5.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>All such actions, when exposed, have their true character made manifest by the Light.</span>
<span class="verse Eph_5_14" data-osis="Eph.5.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>For everything that has its true character made manifest is clear as light. And that is why it is said &mdash; &lsquo;Sleeper, awake! Arise from the dead, and the Christ shall give thee light!&rsquo;</span>
<span class="verse Eph_5_15" data-osis="Eph.5.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>Take great care, then, how you live &mdash; not unwisely but wisely,</span>
<span class="verse Eph_5_16" data-osis="Eph.5.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>making the most of every opportunity; for these are evil days.</span>
<span class="verse Eph_5_17" data-osis="Eph.5.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>Therefore do not grow thoughtless, but try to understand what the Lord&rsquo;s will is.</span>
<span class="verse Eph_5_18" data-osis="Eph.5.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>Do not drink wine to excess, for that leads to profligacy; but seek to be filled with the Spirit of God, and speak to one another in psalms and hymns and sacred songs.</span>
<span class="verse Eph_5_19" data-osis="Eph.5.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>Sing and make music in your hearts to the Lord.</span>
<span class="verse Eph_5_20" data-osis="Eph.5.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>Always give thanks for everything to our God and Father, in the Name of our Lord Jesus Christ;</span>
<span class="verse Eph_5_21" data-osis="Eph.5.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>and submit to one another from reverence for him.</span>
<span class="verse Eph_5_22" data-osis="Eph.5.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>Wives should submit to their husbands as submitting to the Lord.</span>
<span class="verse Eph_5_23" data-osis="Eph.5.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>For a man is the Head of his wife, as the Christ is the Head of the Church &mdash; being indeed himself the Savior of his Body.</span>
<span class="verse Eph_5_24" data-osis="Eph.5.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span>But as the Church submits to the Christ, so also should wives submit to their husbands in everything.</span>
<span class="verse Eph_5_25" data-osis="Eph.5.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span>Husbands, love your wives, just as the Christ loved the Church, and gave himself for her,</span>
<span class="verse Eph_5_26" data-osis="Eph.5.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span>to make her holy, after purifying her by the Washing with the Water, according to his promise;</span>
<span class="verse Eph_5_27" data-osis="Eph.5.27"><span class="verse-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span>so that he might himself bring the Church, in all her beauty, into his own presence, with no spot or wrinkle or blemish of any kind, but that she might be holy and faultless.</span>
<span class="verse Eph_5_28" data-osis="Eph.5.28"><span class="verse-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span>That is how husbands ought to love their wives &mdash; as if they were their own bodies. A man who loves his wife is really loving himself;</span>
<span class="verse Eph_5_29" data-osis="Eph.5.29"><span class="verse-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span>for no one ever yet hated his own body. But every one feeds his body and cares for it, just as the Christ for the Church;</span>
<span class="verse Eph_5_30" data-osis="Eph.5.30"><span class="verse-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span>for we are members of his Body.</span>
<span class="verse Eph_5_31" data-osis="Eph.5.31"><span class="verse-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span>&lsquo;For this cause a man shall leave his father and mother, and be united to his wife; and the man and his wife shall become one.&rsquo;</span>
<span class="verse Eph_5_32" data-osis="Eph.5.32"><span class="verse-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span>In this there is a profound truth &mdash; I am speaking of Christ and his Church.</span>
<span class="verse Eph_5_33" data-osis="Eph.5.33"><span class="verse-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span>However, for you individually, let each love his wife as if she were himself; and the wife be careful to respect her husband.</span>

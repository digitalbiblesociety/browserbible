<span class="verse Eph_6_2" data-osis="Eph.6.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>&lsquo;Honour thy father and mother&rsquo; &mdash; this is the first Commandment with a promise &mdash; &lsquo;</span>
<span class="verse Eph_6_3" data-osis="Eph.6.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>So that thou mayest prosper and have a long life on earth.&rsquo;</span>

<span class="verse Eph_6_5" data-osis="Eph.6.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>Slaves, obey your earthly masters, with anxious care, giving them ungrudging service, as if obeying the Christ;</span>
<span class="verse Eph_6_6" data-osis="Eph.6.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>not only when their eyes are on you, as if you had merely to please men, but as slaves of Christ, who are trying to carry out the will of God.</span>
<span class="verse Eph_6_7" data-osis="Eph.6.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>Give your service heartily and cheerfully, as working for the Master and not for men;</span>
<span class="verse Eph_6_8" data-osis="Eph.6.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>for you know that every one will be rewarded by the Master for any honest work that he has done, whether he is a slave or a freeman.</span>
<span class="verse Eph_6_9" data-osis="Eph.6.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>And masters, treat your slaves in the same spirit. Give up threatening them; for you know that he who is both their Master and yours is in Heaven, and that before him there is no distinction of rank.</span>
<span class="verse Eph_6_10" data-osis="Eph.6.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>For the future, find strength in your union with the Lord, and in the power which comes from his might.</span>

<span class="verse Eph_6_12" data-osis="Eph.6.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>For ours is no struggle against enemies of flesh and blood, but against all the various Powers of Evil that hold sway in the Darkness around us, against the Spirits of Wickedness on high.</span>
<span class="verse Eph_6_13" data-osis="Eph.6.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>Therefore take up the full armour of God, that, when the evil day comes, you may be able to withstand the attack, and, having fought to the end, still to stand your ground.</span>
<span class="verse Eph_6_14" data-osis="Eph.6.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>Stand your ground, then, &lsquo;with truth for your belt,&rsquo; and &lsquo;with righteousness for your breast-plate,&rsquo;</span>
<span class="verse Eph_6_15" data-osis="Eph.6.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>And with the readiness to serve the Good News of Peace as shoes for your feet.</span>
<span class="verse Eph_6_16" data-osis="Eph.6.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>At every onslaught take up faith for your shield; for with it you will be able to extinguish all the flaming darts of the Evil One.</span>
<span class="verse Eph_6_17" data-osis="Eph.6.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>And receive &lsquo;the helmet of Salvation,&rsquo; and &lsquo;the sword of the Spirit&rsquo; &mdash; which is the Message of God &mdash; always with prayer and supplication.</span>
<span class="verse Eph_6_18" data-osis="Eph.6.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>Pray in spirit at all times. Be intent upon this, with unwearying perseverance and supplication for all Christ&rsquo;s People- -</span>
<span class="verse Eph_6_19" data-osis="Eph.6.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>And on my behalf also, that, when I begin to speak, words may be given me, so that I may fearlessly make known the inmost truth of the Good News,</span>
<span class="verse Eph_6_20" data-osis="Eph.6.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>on behalf of which I am an Ambassador &mdash; in chains! Pray that, in telling it, I may speak fearlessly as I ought.</span>
<span class="verse Eph_6_21" data-osis="Eph.6.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>To enable you, as well as others, to know all that concerns me and what I am doing, Tychicus, our dear Brother and faithful helper in the Master&rsquo;s Cause, will tell you everything.</span>
<span class="verse Eph_6_22" data-osis="Eph.6.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>I am sending him to you on purpose that you may learn all about us, and that he may cheer your hearts.</span>
<span class="verse Eph_6_23" data-osis="Eph.6.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>May God, the Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ give our Brothers peace, and love linked with faith.</span>

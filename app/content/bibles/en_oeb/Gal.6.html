<span class="verse Gal_6_1" data-osis="Gal.6.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>My friends, even if someone should be caught committing a sin, you who are spiritually minded should, in a gentle spirit, help them to recover themselves, taking care that you yourselves are not tempted.</span>
<span class="verse Gal_6_2" data-osis="Gal.6.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>Bear one another’s burdens, and so carry out the law of the Christ.</span>
<span class="verse Gal_6_3" data-osis="Gal.6.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>If a person imagines themselves to be somebody, when they are really nobody, they deceive themselves.</span>
<span class="verse Gal_6_4" data-osis="Gal.6.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>Let everyone test their own work, and then their cause for satisfaction will be in themselves and not in a comparison with their neighbor;</span>
<span class="verse Gal_6_5" data-osis="Gal.6.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>for everyone must bear their own load.</span>
<span class="verse Gal_6_6" data-osis="Gal.6.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>The person, however, who is being instructed in the message ought always to share their blessings with their teacher.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Gal_6_7" data-osis="Gal.6.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>Do not be deceived. God cannot be mocked. What a person sows that they will reap.</span>
<span class="verse Gal_6_8" data-osis="Gal.6.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>For the person who sows the field of their earthly nature will from that earthly nature reap corruption; while the one who sows the field of the spirit will from that spirit reap eternal life.</span>
<span class="verse Gal_6_9" data-osis="Gal.6.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>Let us never tire of doing right, for at the proper season we will reap our harvest, if we do not grow weary.</span>
<span class="verse Gal_6_10" data-osis="Gal.6.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>Therefore, I say, as the opportunity occurs, let us treat everyone with kindness, and especially members of the Household of the faith.</span>

<h4>Conclusion in the Apostle’s own handwriting</h4>
<span class="verse Gal_6_11" data-osis="Gal.6.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>See in what large letters I am writing with my own hand.</span>
<span class="verse Gal_6_12" data-osis="Gal.6.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>Those who wish to appear to advantage in regard to outward observances are the  people who are trying to compel you to be circumcised; and they do it only to avoid being persecuted for the cross of Jesus, the Christ.</span>
<span class="verse Gal_6_13" data-osis="Gal.6.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>Even these men who are circumcised do not themselves keep the law; yet they want you to be circumcised, so that they may boast of your observance of the rite.</span>
<span class="verse Gal_6_14" data-osis="Gal.6.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>But, for my part, may I never boast of anything except the cross of Jesus Christ, our Master, through whom the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world.</span>
<span class="verse Gal_6_15" data-osis="Gal.6.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>For neither is circumcision nor the omission of it anything; but a new nature is everything.</span>
<span class="verse Gal_6_16" data-osis="Gal.6.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>May all who rule their conduct by this principle find peace and mercy — they who are the Israel of God.</span>
<span class="verse Gal_6_17" data-osis="Gal.6.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>For the future let no one trouble me; for I bear the marks of Jesus branded on my body.</span>
<span class="verse Gal_6_18" data-osis="Gal.6.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>May the blessing of Jesus Christ, our Lord, rest on your souls, friends. Amen.</span>

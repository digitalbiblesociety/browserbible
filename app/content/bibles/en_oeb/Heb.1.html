<h4>Christ the Mediator</h4>
<span class="verse Heb_1_1" data-osis="Heb.1.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>God, who, of old, at many times and in many ways, spoke to our ancestors, by the prophets,</span>
<span class="verse Heb_1_2" data-osis="Heb.1.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>has in these latter days spoken to us by the Son, whom he appointed the heir of all things, and through whom he made the universe.</span>
<span class="verse Heb_1_3" data-osis="Heb.1.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>For he is the radiance of the glory of God and the  expression of his being, upholding all creation by the power of his word; and, when he had made an expiation for the sins of humanity, he ‘took his seat at the right hand’ of God’s Majesty on high,</span>
<span class="verse Heb_1_4" data-osis="Heb.1.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>having shown himself as much greater than the angels as the name that he has inherited surpasses theirs.</span>
<p>
<span class="verse Heb_1_5" data-osis="Heb.1.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>For to which of the angels did God ever say —<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘You are my Son; this day I have become your Father’?<br /><br />or again —<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘I will be to him a Father, and he will be to me a Son’?<br /><br /></span>
<span class="verse Heb_1_6" data-osis="Heb.1.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>And again, when God brought the first-born into the world, he said —<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘Let all the angels of God bow down before him.’<br /><br /></span>
<span class="verse Heb_1_7" data-osis="Heb.1.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>Speaking of the angels, he said —<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘He makes the winds his angels<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the flames of fire his servants’;<br /><br /></span>
<span class="verse Heb_1_8" data-osis="Heb.1.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>while of the Son he said —<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘God is your throne for ever and ever;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scepter of his kingdom is the scepter of Justice;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
<span class="verse Heb_1_9" data-osis="Heb.1.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>You love righteousness and hates iniquity;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore God, your God, has anointed you with the festal oil more abundantly than your peers.’<br /><br /></span>
<span class="verse Heb_1_10" data-osis="Heb.1.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>Again —<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘You, Lord, in the beginning did lay the foundation of the earth,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the heavens are the work of your hands.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
<span class="verse Heb_1_11" data-osis="Heb.1.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>They will perish, but you remain;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a garment they will all grow old;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
<span class="verse Heb_1_12" data-osis="Heb.1.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>As a mantle you will fold them up,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as a garment they will be changed,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But you are the same, and your years will know no end.’<br /><br /></span>
<span class="verse Heb_1_13" data-osis="Heb.1.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>To which of the angels has God ever said —<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘Sit you at my right hand<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until I put your enemies as a stool for your feet’?<br /><br /></span>
<span class="verse Heb_1_14" data-osis="Heb.1.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>Are not all the angels spirits in the service of God, sent out to minister for the sake of those who are destined to obtain salvation?</span>

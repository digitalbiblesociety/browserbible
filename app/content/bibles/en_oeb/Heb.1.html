<h3>The Letter to the Hebrews</h3>
<h2 class="chapter-num">1</h2>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Heb.1.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>God, who, of old, at many times and in many ways, spoke to our ancestors, by the Prophets,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Heb.1.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>has in these latter days spoken to us by the Son, whom he appointed the heir of all things, and through whom he made the universe.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Heb.1.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>For he is the radiance of the Glory of God and the very expression of his Being, upholding all creation by the power of his word; and, when he had made an expiation for the sins of men, he &lsquo;took his seat at the right hand&rsquo; of God&rsquo;s Majesty on high,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Heb.1.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>having shown himself as much greater than the angels as the Name that he has inherited surpasses theirs.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Heb.1.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>For to which of the angels did God ever say &mdash;  &lsquo;Thou art my Son; this day I have become thy Father&rsquo;? or again &mdash;  &lsquo;I will be to him a Father, and he shall be to me a Son&rsquo;?</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Heb.1.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>And again, when God brought the First-born into the world, he said &mdash;  &lsquo;Let all the angels of God bow down before him.&rsquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Heb.1.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>Speaking of the angels, he said &mdash;  &lsquo;He makes the winds his angels and the fiery flames his servants&rsquo;;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Heb.1.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>while of the Son he said &mdash;  &lsquo;God is thy throne for ever and ever; The sceptre of his Kingdom is the sceptre of Justice;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Heb.1.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>thou lovest righteousness and hatest iniquity; Therefore God, thy God, has anointed thee with the festal oil more abundantly than thy peers.&rsquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Heb.1.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>Again &mdash;  &lsquo;Thou, Lord, in the beginning didst lay the foundation of the earth, and the heavens are the work of thy hands.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Heb.1.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>They shall perish, but thou remainest; As a garment they shall all grow old;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Heb.1.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>as a mantle thou wilt fold them up, And as a garment they shall be changed, But thou art the same, and thy years shall know no end.&rsquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Heb.1.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>To which of the angels has God ever said &mdash;  &lsquo;Sit thou at my right hand until I put thy enemies as a stool for thy feet&rsquo;?</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Heb.1.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>Are not all the angels spirits in the service of God, sent out to minister for the sake of those who are destined to obtain Salvation?</span>

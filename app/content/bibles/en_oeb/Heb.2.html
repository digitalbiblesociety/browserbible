<h2 class="chapter-num">2</h2>
<p>
<span class="verse Heb_2_1" data-osis="Heb.2.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>Therefore we must give still more heed to what we were taught, so we do not drift away.</span>
<span class="verse Heb_2_2" data-osis="Heb.2.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>For, if the message which was delivered by angels had its authority confirmed, so that every offense against it, or neglect of it, met with a fitting requital,</span>
<span class="verse Heb_2_3" data-osis="Heb.2.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>how can we, of all people, expect to escape, if we disregard so great a salvation? It was the Master who at the outset spoke of this salvation, and its authority was confirmed for us by those who heard him,</span>
<span class="verse Heb_2_4" data-osis="Heb.2.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>while God himself added his testimony to it by signs, and marvels, and many different miracles, as well as by imparting the Holy Spirit as he saw fit.</span>
<span class="verse Heb_2_5" data-osis="Heb.2.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>God has not given to angels the control of that future world of which we are speaking!</span>
<span class="verse Heb_2_6" data-osis="Heb.2.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>No; a writer has declared somewhere —<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘What are mere mortals that you should remember them?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or human beings that you should care for them?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
<span class="verse Heb_2_7" data-osis="Heb.2.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>You have made them, for a while, lower than angels;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With glory and honor you have crowned them;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have set them over all that your hands have made;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
<span class="verse Heb_2_8" data-osis="Heb.2.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>You have placed all things beneath their feet.’<br /><br />This ‘placing of everything’ under humanity means that there was nothing which was not placed under them. As yet, however, we do not see everything placed under humanity.</span>
<span class="verse Heb_2_9" data-osis="Heb.2.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>What our eyes do see is Jesus, who was made for a while lower than angels, now, because of his sufferings and death, crowned with glory and honor; so that his tasting the bitterness of death should, in God’s loving kindness, be on behalf of all humanity.</span>
<span class="verse Heb_2_10" data-osis="Heb.2.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>It was, indeed, fitting that God, for whom and through whom all things exist, should, when leading many children to glory, make the author of their salvation perfect through suffering.</span>
<span class="verse Heb_2_11" data-osis="Heb.2.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>For he who purifies, and those whom he purifies, all spring from One; and therefore he is not ashamed to call them his brothers and sisters.’</span>
<span class="verse Heb_2_12" data-osis="Heb.2.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>He says —<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘I will tell of your name to my brothers and sisters,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the midst of the congregation I will sing your praise.’<br /><br /></span>
<span class="verse Heb_2_13" data-osis="Heb.2.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>And again —<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘As for me, I will put my trust in God.’<br /><br />And yet again —<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘See, here am I and the children whom God gave me.’<br /><br /></span>
<span class="verse Heb_2_14" data-osis="Heb.2.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>Therefore, since human nature is the common heritage of ‘the children,’ Jesus also shared it, in order that by death he might render powerless him whose power lies in death — that is, the devil —</span>
<span class="verse Heb_2_15" data-osis="Heb.2.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>and so might deliver all those who, from fear of death, had all their lives been living in slavery.</span>
<span class="verse Heb_2_16" data-osis="Heb.2.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>It was not, surely, to the help of the angels that Jesus came, but ‘to the help of the descendants of Abraham.’</span>
<span class="verse Heb_2_17" data-osis="Heb.2.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>And consequently it was necessary that he should in all points be made like ‘his brothers and sisters,’ in order that he might prove a merciful as well as a faithful high priest in humanity’s relations with God, for the purpose of expiating the sins of his people.</span>
<span class="verse Heb_2_18" data-osis="Heb.2.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>The fact that he himself suffered under temptation enables him to help those who are tempted.</span>

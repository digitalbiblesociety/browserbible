<span class="verse Heb_3_1" data-osis="Heb.3.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>Therefore, my Christian friends, you who, all alike, have received the call from heaven, fix your attention on Jesus, the apostle and high priest of our religion.</span>
<span class="verse Heb_3_2" data-osis="Heb.3.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>See how faithful he was to the God who appointed him, as Moses was in the whole house of God.</span>
<span class="verse Heb_3_3" data-osis="Heb.3.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>He has been deemed worthy of far higher honor than Moses, just as the founder of the house is held in greater regard than the house itself.</span>
<span class="verse Heb_3_4" data-osis="Heb.3.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>For every house has its founder, and the founder of the universe is God.</span>
<span class="verse Heb_3_5" data-osis="Heb.3.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>While the faithful service of Moses in the whole house of God was that of a servant, whose duty was to bear testimony to a message still to come,</span>
<span class="verse Heb_3_6" data-osis="Heb.3.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>the faithfulness of Christ was that of a son set over the house of God. And we are his house — if only we retain, unshaken to the end, the courage and confidence inspired by our hope.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Heb_3_7" data-osis="Heb.3.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>Therefore, as the Holy Spirit says —<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘If today you hear God’s voice,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
<span class="verse Heb_3_8" data-osis="Heb.3.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>harden not your hearts, as when Israel provoked me<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the day when they tried my patience in the desert,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
<span class="verse Heb_3_9" data-osis="Heb.3.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>Where your ancestors tried my forbearance,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And saw my mighty deeds for forty years.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
<span class="verse Heb_3_10" data-osis="Heb.3.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>Therefore I was sorely vexed with that generation,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I said —  “Their hearts are always straying;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have never learned my ways”;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
<span class="verse Heb_3_11" data-osis="Heb.3.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>While in my wrath I swore —<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“They will never enter upon my rest.”’<br /><br /></span>
<span class="verse Heb_3_12" data-osis="Heb.3.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>Be careful, friends, that there is never found in anyone of you a wicked and faithless heart, shown by that person separating themselves from the living God.</span>
<span class="verse Heb_3_13" data-osis="Heb.3.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>Rather encourage one another daily — while there is a ‘Today’ — to prevent anyone among you from being hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.</span>
<span class="verse Heb_3_14" data-osis="Heb.3.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>For we now all share in the Christ, if indeed we retain, unshaken to the end, the confidence that we had at the first.</span>
<span class="verse Heb_3_15" data-osis="Heb.3.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>To use the words of scripture —<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘If today you hear God’s voice,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harden not your hearts, as when Israel provoked me.’<br /><br /></span>
<span class="verse Heb_3_16" data-osis="Heb.3.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>Who were they who heard God speak and yet provoked him? Were not they all those who left Egypt under the leadership of Moses?</span>
<span class="verse Heb_3_17" data-osis="Heb.3.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>And with whom was it that God was sorely vexed for forty years? Was not it with those who had sinned, and who fell dead in the desert?</span>
<span class="verse Heb_3_18" data-osis="Heb.3.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>And who were they to whom God swore that they should not enter upon his rest, if not those who had proved faithless?</span>
<span class="verse Heb_3_19" data-osis="Heb.3.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>We see, then, that they failed to enter upon it because of their want of faith.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Heb.8.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>To sum up what I have been saying: &mdash; Such is the High Priest that we have, one who &lsquo;has taken his seat at the right hand&rsquo; of the throne of God&rsquo;s Majesty in Heaven,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Heb.8.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>where he ministers in the Sanctuary, in that true Tabernacle set up by the Lord and not by man.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Heb.8.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>Every High Priest is appointed for the purpose of offering gifts and sacrifices to God; it follows, therefore, that this High Priest must have some offering to make.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Heb.8.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>If he were, however, still upon earth, he would not even be a priest, since there are already priests who offer the gifts as the Law directs.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Heb.8.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>(These priests, it is true, are engaged in a service which is only a copy and shadow of the heavenly realities, as is shown by the directions given to Moses when he was about to construct the Tabernacle. &lsquo;Look to it,&rsquo; are the words, &lsquo;that thou make every part in accordance with the pattern shown thee on the mountain.&rsquo;)</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Heb.8.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>But Jesus, as we see, has obtained a ministry as far excelling theirs, as the Covenant of which he is the intermediary, based, as it is, on better promises, excels the former Covenant.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Heb.8.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>If that first Covenant had been faultless, there would have been no occasion for a second.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Heb.8.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>But, finding fault with the people, God says &mdash;  &lsquo;&ldquo;Behold, a time is coming,&rdquo; says the Lord, &ldquo;when I will ratify a new Covenant with the People of Israel and with the People of Judah &mdash;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Heb.8.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>Not such a Covenant as I made with their ancestors on the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt. For they did not abide by their Covenant with me, And therefore I disregarded them,&rdquo; says the Lord.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Heb.8.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;This is the Covenant that I will make with the People of Israel After those days,&rdquo; says the Lord. &ldquo;I will impress my laws on their minds, and will inscribe them on their hearts; And I will be their God, and they shall be my People.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Heb.8.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>There shall be no need for every man to instruct his fellow-citizen, or for a man to say to his Brother &lsquo;Learn to know the Lord&rsquo;; For every one will know me, From the lowest to the highest.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Heb.8.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>For I will be merciful to their wrong-doings, And I will no longer remember their sins.&rdquo;&rsquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Heb.8.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>By speaking of a &lsquo;new&rsquo; Covenant, God at once renders the former Covenant obsolete; and whatever becomes obsolete and loses its force is virtually annulled.</span>

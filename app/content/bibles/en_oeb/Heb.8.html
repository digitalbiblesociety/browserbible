<h2 class="chapter-num">8</h2>
<p>
<span class="verse Heb_8_1" data-osis="Heb.8.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>To sum up what I have been saying: — Such is the high priest that we have, one who ‘has taken his seat at the right hand’ of the throne of God’s Majesty in heaven,</span>
<span class="verse Heb_8_2" data-osis="Heb.8.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>where he ministers in the sanctuary, in that true tent set up by the Lord and not by man.</span>
<span class="verse Heb_8_3" data-osis="Heb.8.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>Every high priest is appointed for the purpose of offering gifts and sacrifices to God; it follows, therefore, that this high priest must have some offering to make.</span>
<span class="verse Heb_8_4" data-osis="Heb.8.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>If he were, however, still on earth, he would not even be a priest, since there are already priests who offer the gifts as the law directs.</span>
<span class="verse Heb_8_5" data-osis="Heb.8.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>(These priests, it is true, are engaged in a service which is only a copy and shadow of the heavenly realities, as is shown by the directions given to Moses when he was about to construct the tent. ‘Look to it,’ are the words, ‘that you make every part in accordance with the pattern shown you on the mountain.’)</span>
<span class="verse Heb_8_6" data-osis="Heb.8.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>But Jesus, as we see, has obtained a ministry as far excelling theirs, as the covenant of which he is the intermediary, based, as it is, on better promises, excels the former covenant.</span>
<span class="verse Heb_8_7" data-osis="Heb.8.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>If that first covenant had been faultless, there would have been no occasion for a second.</span>
<span class="verse Heb_8_8" data-osis="Heb.8.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>But, finding fault with the people, God says —<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘“A time is coming,” says the Lord,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“When I will ratify a new covenant with the people of Israel and with the people of Judah —<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
<span class="verse Heb_8_9" data-osis="Heb.8.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>Not such a covenant as I made with their ancestors<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For they did not abide by their covenant with me,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And therefore I disregarded them,” says the Lord.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
<span class="verse Heb_8_10" data-osis="Heb.8.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>“This is the covenant that I will make with the people of Israel<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After those days,” says the Lord.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I will impress my laws on their minds,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And will inscribe them on their hearts;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I will be their God,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they will be my people.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
<span class="verse Heb_8_11" data-osis="Heb.8.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>There will be no need for anyone to instruct their fellow citizen,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or for a person to say to their relatives ‘Learn to know the Lord’;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For everyone will know me,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the lowest to the highest.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
<span class="verse Heb_8_12" data-osis="Heb.8.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>For I will be merciful to their wrong-doings,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I will no longer remember their sins.”’<br /><br /></span>
<span class="verse Heb_8_13" data-osis="Heb.8.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>By speaking of a ‘new’ covenant, God at once renders the former covenant obsolete; and whatever becomes obsolete and loses its force is virtually annulled.</span>

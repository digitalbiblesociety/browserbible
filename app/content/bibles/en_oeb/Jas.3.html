<p>
<span class="verse Jas_3_1" data-osis="Jas.3.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>I do not want many of you, my friends, to become teachers, knowing, as you do, that we who teach will be judged by a more severe standard than others.</span>
<span class="verse Jas_3_2" data-osis="Jas.3.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>We often make mistakes, every one of us. Anyone who does not make mistakes when speaking is indeed a perfect person, able to bridle their whole body as well.</span>
<span class="verse Jas_3_3" data-osis="Jas.3.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>When we put bits into horses’ mouths, to make them obey us, we control the rest of their bodies so.</span>
<span class="verse Jas_3_4" data-osis="Jas.3.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>Again, think of ships. Large as they are, and even when driven by fierce winds, they are controlled by a very small rudder and steered in whatever direction the man at the helm may determine.</span>
<span class="verse Jas_3_5" data-osis="Jas.3.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>So is it with the tongue. Small as it is, it is a great boaster. Think how tiny a spark may set the largest forest ablaze!</span>
<span class="verse Jas_3_6" data-osis="Jas.3.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>And the tongue is like a spark. Among the members of our body it proves itself a  world of mischief; it contaminates the whole body; it sets the wheels of life on fire, and is itself set on fire by the flames of Gehenna.</span>
<span class="verse Jas_3_7" data-osis="Jas.3.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>For while all sorts of beasts and birds, and of reptiles and creatures in the sea, are tameable, and actually have been tamed by man,</span>
<span class="verse Jas_3_8" data-osis="Jas.3.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>no human being can tame the tongue. It is a restless plague! It is charged with deadly poison!</span>
<span class="verse Jas_3_9" data-osis="Jas.3.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>With it we bless our Lord and Father, and with it we curse people who are made ‘in God’s likeness.’</span>
<span class="verse Jas_3_10" data-osis="Jas.3.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>From the very same mouth come blessings and curses! My friends, it is not right that this should be so.</span>
<span class="verse Jas_3_11" data-osis="Jas.3.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>Does a spring give both good and bad water from the same source?</span>
<span class="verse Jas_3_12" data-osis="Jas.3.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>Can a fig tree, my friends, bear olives? Or a vine bear figs? No, nor can a brackish well give good water.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Jas_3_13" data-osis="Jas.3.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>Who among you claims to be wise and intelligent? Let them show that their actions are the outcome of a good life lived in the humility of true wisdom.</span>
<span class="verse Jas_3_14" data-osis="Jas.3.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>But, while you harbor envy and bitterness and a spirit of rivalry in your hearts, do not boast or lie to the detriment of the truth.</span>
<span class="verse Jas_3_15" data-osis="Jas.3.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>That is not the wisdom which comes from above; no, it is earthly, animal, devilish.</span>
<span class="verse Jas_3_16" data-osis="Jas.3.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>For, where envy and rivalry exist, there you will also find disorder and all kinds of base actions.</span>
<span class="verse Jas_3_17" data-osis="Jas.3.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>But the wisdom from above is, before every thing else, pure; then peace-loving, gentle, open to conviction, rich in compassion and good deeds, and free from partiality and insincerity.</span>
<span class="verse Jas_3_18" data-osis="Jas.3.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>And righteousness, its fruit, is sown in peace by those who work for peace.</span>

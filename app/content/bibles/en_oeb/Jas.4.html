<p>
<span class="verse Jas_4_1" data-osis="Jas.4.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>What is the cause of the fighting and quarreling that goes on among you? Is not it to be found in the desires which are always at war within you?</span>
<span class="verse Jas_4_2" data-osis="Jas.4.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>You crave, yet do not obtain. You murder and rage, yet cannot gain your end. You quarrel and fight. You do not obtain, because you do not ask.</span>
<span class="verse Jas_4_3" data-osis="Jas.4.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>You ask, yet do not receive, because you ask for a wrong purpose — to spend what you get on your pleasures.</span>
<span class="verse Jas_4_4" data-osis="Jas.4.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>Unfaithful people! Don’t you know that to be friends with the world means to be at enmity with God? Therefore whoever chooses to be friends with the world makes himself an enemy to God.</span>
<span class="verse Jas_4_5" data-osis="Jas.4.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>Do you suppose there is no meaning in the passage of scripture which asks — ‘Is envy to result from the longings of the Spirit which God has implanted within you?’</span>
<span class="verse Jas_4_6" data-osis="Jas.4.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>No; the gift that God gives is for a nobler end; and that is why it is said — ‘God is opposed to the haughty, but gives help to the humble.’</span>
<span class="verse Jas_4_7" data-osis="Jas.4.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>Therefore submit to God; but resist the devil, and he will flee from you.</span>
<span class="verse Jas_4_8" data-osis="Jas.4.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>Draw near to God, and he will draw near to you. Make your hands clean, you sinners; and your hearts pure, you vacillator!</span>
<span class="verse Jas_4_9" data-osis="Jas.4.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>Grieve, mourn, and lament! Let your laughter be turned to mourning, and your happiness to gloom!</span>
<span class="verse Jas_4_10" data-osis="Jas.4.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>Humble yourselves before the Lord, and he will exalt you.</span>
<span class="verse Jas_4_11" data-osis="Jas.4.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>Do not disparage one another, friends. The person who disparages others, or passes judgment on them, disparages the law and passes judgment on the law. But, if you pass judgment on the law, you are not obeying it, but judging it.</span>
<span class="verse Jas_4_12" data-osis="Jas.4.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>There is only one lawgiver and judge — he who has the power both to save and to destroy. But who are you that pass judgment on your neighbor?</span>
<span class="verse Jas_4_13" data-osis="Jas.4.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>Listen to me, you who say ‘Today or tomorrow we will go to such and such a town, spend a year there, and trade, and make money,’</span>
<span class="verse Jas_4_14" data-osis="Jas.4.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>And yet you do not know what your life will be like tomorrow! For you are but a mist appearing for a little while and then disappearing.</span>
<span class="verse Jas_4_15" data-osis="Jas.4.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>You ought, rather, to say ‘If the Lord wills, we will live and do this or that.’</span>
<span class="verse Jas_4_16" data-osis="Jas.4.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>But, as it is, you are constantly boasting presumptuously! All such boasting is wicked.</span>
<span class="verse Jas_4_17" data-osis="Jas.4.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>The person, then, who knows what is right but fails to do it — that is sin in them.</span>

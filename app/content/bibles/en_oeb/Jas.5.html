<p>
<span class="verse Jas_5_1" data-osis="Jas.5.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>Listen to me, you rich people, weep and wail for the miseries that are coming upon you!</span>
<span class="verse Jas_5_2" data-osis="Jas.5.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>Your riches have wasted away, and your clothes have become moth-eaten.</span>
<span class="verse Jas_5_3" data-osis="Jas.5.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>Your gold and silver are rusted; and the rust on them will be evidence against you, and will eat into your  flesh. It was fire, so to speak, that you stored up for yourselves in these last days.</span>
<span class="verse Jas_5_4" data-osis="Jas.5.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>I tell you, the wages of the laborers who mowed your fields, which you have been fraudulently keeping back, are crying out against you, and the outcries of your reapers have reached the ears of the Lord of Hosts!</span>
<span class="verse Jas_5_5" data-osis="Jas.5.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>You have lived on earth a life of extravagance and luxury; you have indulged your fancies in a time of bloodshed.</span>
<span class="verse Jas_5_6" data-osis="Jas.5.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>You have condemned, you have murdered, the righteous one! Must not God be opposed to you?</span>
</p>
<h4>Concluding Appeal</h4>
<span class="verse Jas_5_7" data-osis="Jas.5.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>Be patient, then, friends, until the coming of the Lord. Even the farmer has to wait for the precious fruit of the earth, watching over it patiently, until it has had the spring and summer rains.</span>
<span class="verse Jas_5_8" data-osis="Jas.5.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>And you must be patient also, and not be discouraged; for the Lord’s coming is near.</span>
<span class="verse Jas_5_9" data-osis="Jas.5.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>Do not make complaints against one another, friends, or judgment will be passed on you. The judge is already standing at the door!</span>
<span class="verse Jas_5_10" data-osis="Jas.5.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>Friends, as an example of the patient endurance of suffering, take the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord.</span>
<span class="verse Jas_5_11" data-osis="Jas.5.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>We count those who displayed such endurance blessed! You have heard, too, of Job’s endurance, and have seen what the Lord’s purpose was, for ‘the Lord is full of pity and compassion.’</span>
<p>
<span class="verse Jas_5_12" data-osis="Jas.5.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>Above all things, my friends, never take an oath, either by heaven, or by earth, or by anything else. With you let ‘Yes’ suffice for yes, and ‘No’ for no, so that you may escape condemnation.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Jas_5_13" data-osis="Jas.5.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>If any of you is in trouble, let them pray; if anyone is happy, let them sing hymns.</span>
<span class="verse Jas_5_14" data-osis="Jas.5.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>If anyone of you is ill, let him send for the officers of the church, and let them pray over them, after anointing them with oil in the name of the Lord.</span>
<span class="verse Jas_5_15" data-osis="Jas.5.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>The prayer offered in faith will save the person who is sick, and the Lord will raise them from their bed; and if they have committed sins, they will be forgiven.</span>
<span class="verse Jas_5_16" data-osis="Jas.5.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>Therefore, confess your sins to one another and pray for one another, so that you may be cured. Great is the power of a good person’s fervent prayer.</span>
<span class="verse Jas_5_17" data-osis="Jas.5.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>Elijah was only human like ourselves, but, when he prayed fervently that it might not rain, no rain fell on the land for three years and a half.</span>
<span class="verse Jas_5_18" data-osis="Jas.5.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>And, when he prayed again, the clouds brought rain, and the land bore crops.</span>
<span class="verse Jas_5_19" data-osis="Jas.5.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>My friends, should one of you be led astray from the truth, and someone bring them back again,</span>
<span class="verse Jas_5_20" data-osis="Jas.5.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>be sure that the person who brings a sinner back from their mistaken ways will save that person’s soul from death, and throw a veil over countless sins.</span>

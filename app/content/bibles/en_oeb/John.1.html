<h4>Introduction</h4><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse John_1_1" data-osis="John.1.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>In the beginning the Word was;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the Word was with God;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the Word was God.<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
<span class="verse John_1_2" data-osis="John.1.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>He was in the beginning with God;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
<span class="verse John_1_3" data-osis="John.1.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>through him all things came into being,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and nothing came into being apart from him.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
<span class="verse John_1_4" data-osis="John.1.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>That which came into being in him was life;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the life was the light of humanity;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
<span class="verse John_1_5" data-osis="John.1.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>and the light shines in the darkness,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the darkness never overpowered it.<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
<span class="verse John_1_6" data-osis="John.1.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>There appeared a man sent from God, whose name was John;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
<span class="verse John_1_7" data-osis="John.1.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>he came as a witness — to bear witness to the light<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so that through him everyone might believe.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
<span class="verse John_1_8" data-osis="John.1.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>He was not the light,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but he came to bear witness to the light.<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
<span class="verse John_1_9" data-osis="John.1.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>That was the true light which enlightens everyone coming into the world.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
<span class="verse John_1_10" data-osis="John.1.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>He was in the world;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and through him the world came into being —<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;yet the world did not know him.<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
<span class="verse John_1_11" data-osis="John.1.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>He came to his own —<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;yet his own did not receive him.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
<span class="verse John_1_12" data-osis="John.1.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>But to all who did receive him he gave power to become children of God —<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to those who believe in his name.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
<span class="verse John_1_13" data-osis="John.1.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>For not to natural conception, nor to human instincts, nor to human will did they owe the new life,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but to God.<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
<span class="verse John_1_14" data-osis="John.1.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>And the Word became human, and lived among us,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(We saw his glory — the glory of the Only Son sent from the Father),<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;full of love and truth.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
<span class="verse John_1_15" data-osis="John.1.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>(John bears witness to him; he cried aloud — for it was he who spoke —<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“‘He who is coming’ after me is now before me,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for he was ever first”);<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
<span class="verse John_1_16" data-osis="John.1.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>out of his fullness we have all received some gift,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gift after gift of love;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
<span class="verse John_1_17" data-osis="John.1.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>for the law was given through Moses,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;love and truth came through Jesus Christ.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
<span class="verse John_1_18" data-osis="John.1.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>No one has ever yet seen God;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God the Only Son, who is ever with the Father —<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has revealed him.<br /><br /></span>
<h4>The Preparation</h4>
<span class="verse John_1_19" data-osis="John.1.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>When the religious authorities in Jerusalem sent some Priests and Levites to ask John — “Who are you?”,</span>
<span class="verse John_1_20" data-osis="John.1.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>he told them clearly and simply: “I am not the Christ.”</span>
<p>
<span class="verse John_1_21" data-osis="John.1.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>“What then?” they asked. “Are you Elijah?”</span>
</p>
<p>“No,” he said, “I am not.”
</p>
<p>“Are you ‘the prophet’?” He answered, “No.”
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_1_22" data-osis="John.1.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>“Who then are you?” they continued; “tell us so that we have an answer to give to those who have sent us. What do you say about yourself?”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_1_23" data-osis="John.1.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>“I,” he answered, “am —<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘The voice of one crying aloud in the wilderness — “make a straight road for the Lord”’,<br /><br />as the prophet Isaiah said.”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_1_24" data-osis="John.1.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span>These men had been sent from the Pharisees;</span>
<span class="verse John_1_25" data-osis="John.1.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span>and their next question was: “Why then do you baptize, if you are not the Christ or Elijah or ‘the prophet’?”</span>
<span class="verse John_1_26" data-osis="John.1.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span>John’s answer was — “I baptize with water, but among you stands one whom you do not know;</span>
<span class="verse John_1_27" data-osis="John.1.27"><span class="verse-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span>he is coming after me, yet I am not worthy even to unfasten his sandal.”</span>
<span class="verse John_1_28" data-osis="John.1.28"><span class="verse-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span>This happened at Bethany, across the Jordan, where John was baptizing.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_1_29" data-osis="John.1.29"><span class="verse-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span>The next day John saw Jesus coming towards him, and exclaimed: “Here is the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!</span>
<span class="verse John_1_30" data-osis="John.1.30"><span class="verse-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span>I was taking about him when I said ‘After me there is coming a man who ranks ahead of me, because before I was born he already was.’</span>
<span class="verse John_1_31" data-osis="John.1.31"><span class="verse-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span>I did not know who he was, but I have come baptizing with water to make him known to Israel.”</span>
<span class="verse John_1_32" data-osis="John.1.32"><span class="verse-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span>John also said:</span>
</p>
<p>“I saw the Spirit come down from heaven like a dove and rest on him.
<span class="verse John_1_33" data-osis="John.1.33"><span class="verse-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span>I myself did not know him, but he who sent me to baptize with water, he said to me ‘He on whom you see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him — he it is who baptizes with the Holy Spirit.’</span>
<span class="verse John_1_34" data-osis="John.1.34"><span class="verse-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span>This I have seen myself, and I have declared my belief that he is the Son of God.”</span>
<span class="verse John_1_35" data-osis="John.1.35"><span class="verse-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span>The next day, when John was standing with two of his disciples,</span>
<span class="verse John_1_36" data-osis="John.1.36"><span class="verse-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span>he looked at Jesus as he passed and exclaimed: “There is the Lamb of God!”</span>
<span class="verse John_1_37" data-osis="John.1.37"><span class="verse-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span>The two disciples heard him say this, and followed Jesus.</span>
<span class="verse John_1_38" data-osis="John.1.38"><span class="verse-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span>But Jesus turned around, and saw them following. <span class="woc">“What are you looking for?”</span>he asked. “Rabbi,” they answered (or, as we should say, ‘teacher’), “where are you staying?”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_1_39" data-osis="John.1.39"><span class="verse-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">“Come, and you will see,”</span>he replied. So they went, and saw where he was staying, and spent that day with him.</span>
</p>
<p>It was then about four in the afternoon.
<span class="verse John_1_40" data-osis="John.1.40"><span class="verse-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span>One of the two, who heard what John said and followed Jesus, was Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother.</span>
<span class="verse John_1_41" data-osis="John.1.41"><span class="verse-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span>He first found his own brother Simon, and said to him: “We have found the Messiah!” (a word which means ‘Christ,’ or ‘Consecrated’.)</span>
<span class="verse John_1_42" data-osis="John.1.42"><span class="verse-num v-42">42&nbsp;</span>Then he brought him to Jesus. Looking straight at him, Jesus said: <span class="woc">“You are Simon, the son of John; you will be called Cephas”</span>(which means ‘Peter,’ or ‘Rock’).</span>
<span class="verse John_1_43" data-osis="John.1.43"><span class="verse-num v-43">43&nbsp;</span>The following day Jesus decided to leave for Galilee. He found Philip, and said to him: <span class="woc">“Follow me.”</span></span>
<span class="verse John_1_44" data-osis="John.1.44"><span class="verse-num v-44">44&nbsp;</span>Philip was from Bethsaida, the same town as Andrew and Peter.</span>
<span class="verse John_1_45" data-osis="John.1.45"><span class="verse-num v-45">45&nbsp;</span>He found Nathanael and said to him: “We have found him of whom Moses wrote in the law, and of whom the prophets also wrote — Jesus of Nazareth, Joseph’s son!”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_1_46" data-osis="John.1.46"><span class="verse-num v-46">46&nbsp;</span>“Can anything good come out of Nazareth?” asked Nathanael. “Come and see,” replied Philip.</span>
<span class="verse John_1_47" data-osis="John.1.47"><span class="verse-num v-47">47&nbsp;</span>When Jesus saw Nathanael coming towards him, he said: <span class="woc">“Here is a true Israelite, in whom there is no deceit!”</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_1_48" data-osis="John.1.48"><span class="verse-num v-48">48&nbsp;</span>“How do you know me?” asked Nathanael. <span class="woc">“Even before Philip called you,”</span>replied Jesus, <span class="woc">“when you were under the fig tree, I saw you.”</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_1_49" data-osis="John.1.49"><span class="verse-num v-49">49&nbsp;</span>“Rabbi,” Nathanael exclaimed, “you are the Son of God, you are king of Israel!”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_1_50" data-osis="John.1.50"><span class="verse-num v-50">50&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">“Do you believe in me,”</span>asked Jesus, <span class="woc">“because I told you that I saw you under the fig tree? You will see greater things than those!</span></span>
<span class="verse John_1_51" data-osis="John.1.51"><span class="verse-num v-51">51&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">In truth I tell you,”</span>he added, <span class="woc">“you will all see heaven open, and ‘the angels of God ascending and descending’ on the Son of Man.”</span></span>

<h2 class="chapter-num">10</h2>
<p>
<span class="verse John_10_1" data-osis="John.10.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">In truth I tell you, whoever does not go into the sheepfold through the door, but climbs up at some other place, that person is a thief and a robber;</span></span>
<span class="verse John_10_2" data-osis="John.10.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">but the person who goes in through the door is shepherd to the sheep.</span></span>
<span class="verse John_10_3" data-osis="John.10.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">For him the watchman opens the door; and the sheep listen to his voice; and he calls his own sheep by name, and leads them out.</span></span>
<span class="verse John_10_4" data-osis="John.10.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">When he has brought them all out, he walks in front of them, and his sheep follow him, because they know his voice.</span></span>
<span class="verse John_10_5" data-osis="John.10.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">They will not follow a stranger, but will run away from him; because they do not know a stranger’s voice.”</span></span>
<span class="verse John_10_6" data-osis="John.10.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>This was the allegory that Jesus told them, but they did not understand of what he was speaking.</span>
<span class="verse John_10_7" data-osis="John.10.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>So he continued: <span class="woc">“In truth I tell you, I am the door for the sheep.</span></span>
<span class="verse John_10_8" data-osis="John.10.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">All who came before me were thieves and robbers; but the sheep did not listen to them.</span></span>
<span class="verse John_10_9" data-osis="John.10.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">I am the door; he who goes in through me will be safe, and he will go in and out and find pasture.</span></span>
<span class="verse John_10_10" data-osis="John.10.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">The thief comes only to steal, to kill, and to destroy; I have come so that they may have life, and may have it in greater fullness.</span></span>
<span class="verse John_10_11" data-osis="John.10.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for his sheep.</span></span>
<span class="verse John_10_12" data-osis="John.10.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">The hired man who is not a shepherd, and who does not own the sheep, when he sees a wolf coming, leaves them and runs away; then the wolf seizes them, and scatters the flock.</span></span>
<span class="verse John_10_13" data-osis="John.10.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">He does this because he is only a hired man and does not care about the sheep.</span></span>
<span class="verse John_10_14" data-osis="John.10.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">I am the good shepherd; and I know my sheep, and my sheep know me — </span></span>
<span class="verse John_10_15" data-osis="John.10.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Just as the Father knows me and I know the Father — and I lay down my life for the sheep.</span></span>
<span class="verse John_10_16" data-osis="John.10.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">I have other sheep besides, which do not belong to this fold; I must lead them also, and they will listen to my voice; and they will become one flock under ‘one shepherd.’</span></span>
<span class="verse John_10_17" data-osis="John.10.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">This is why the Father loves me, because I lay down my life — to receive it again.</span></span>
<span class="verse John_10_18" data-osis="John.10.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">No one took it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have authority to lay it down, and I have authority to receive it again. This is the command which I received from my Father.”</span></span>
<span class="verse John_10_19" data-osis="John.10.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>In consequence of these words a difference of opinion again arose among the people.</span>
<span class="verse John_10_20" data-osis="John.10.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>Many of them said: “He is possessed by a demon and is mad; why do you listen to him?”</span>
<span class="verse John_10_21" data-osis="John.10.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>Others said: “This is not the teaching of one who is possessed by a demon. Can a demon give sight to the blind?”</span>
<span class="verse John_10_22" data-osis="John.10.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>Soon after this the Festival of the Rededication was held at Jerusalem.</span>
<span class="verse John_10_23" data-osis="John.10.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>It was winter; and Jesus was walking in the Temple Courts, in the Colonnade of Solomon,</span>
<span class="verse John_10_24" data-osis="John.10.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span>when the people gathered around him, and said: “How long are you going to keep us in suspense? If you are the Christ, tell us so frankly.”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_10_25" data-osis="John.10.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">“I have told you so,”</span>replied Jesus, <span class="woc">“and you do not believe me. The work that I am doing in my Father’s name bears testimony to me.</span></span>
<span class="verse John_10_26" data-osis="John.10.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">But you do not believe me, because you are not of my flock.</span></span>
<span class="verse John_10_27" data-osis="John.10.27"><span class="verse-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">My sheep listen to my voice; I know them, and they follow me;</span></span>
<span class="verse John_10_28" data-osis="John.10.28"><span class="verse-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">and I give them eternal life, and they will not be lost; nor will anyone snatch them out of my hands.</span></span>
<span class="verse John_10_29" data-osis="John.10.29"><span class="verse-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">What my Father has entrusted to me is more than all else; and no one can snatch anything out of the Father’s hands.</span></span>
<span class="verse John_10_30" data-osis="John.10.30"><span class="verse-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">The Father and I are one.”</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_10_31" data-osis="John.10.31"><span class="verse-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span>Some of the people again brought stones to throw at him;</span>
<span class="verse John_10_32" data-osis="John.10.32"><span class="verse-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span>and seeing this, Jesus said: <span class="woc">“I have done before your eyes many good actions, inspired by the Father; for which of them would you stone me?”</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_10_33" data-osis="John.10.33"><span class="verse-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span>“It is not for any good action that we would stone you,” they answered, “but for blasphemy; and because you, who are only a man, make yourself out to be God.”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_10_34" data-osis="John.10.34"><span class="verse-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">“Are there not,”</span>replied Jesus, <span class="woc">“these words in your law — ‘I said “You are gods”’?</span></span>
<span class="verse John_10_35" data-osis="John.10.35"><span class="verse-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">If those to whom God’s word were addressed were said to be ‘gods’ — and scripture cannot be set aside — </span></span>
<span class="verse John_10_36" data-osis="John.10.36"><span class="verse-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Do you say of one whom the Father has consecrated and sent as his messenger to the world ‘You are blaspheming,’ because I said ‘I am God’s Son’?</span></span>
<span class="verse John_10_37" data-osis="John.10.37"><span class="verse-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">If I am not doing the work that my Father is doing, do not believe me;</span></span>
<span class="verse John_10_38" data-osis="John.10.38"><span class="verse-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">if I am doing it, even though you do not believe me, believe what that work shows; so that you may understand, and understand more and more clearly, that the Father is in union with me, and I with the Father.”</span></span>
<span class="verse John_10_39" data-osis="John.10.39"><span class="verse-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span>The authorities again sought to arrest him; but he escaped their hands.</span>
<span class="verse John_10_40" data-osis="John.10.40"><span class="verse-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span>Then Jesus again crossed the Jordan to the place where John used to baptize at first, and stayed there some time, during which many people came to see him.</span>
<span class="verse John_10_41" data-osis="John.10.41"><span class="verse-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span>“John gave no sign of his mission,” they said; “but everything that he said about this man was true.”</span>
<span class="verse John_10_42" data-osis="John.10.42"><span class="verse-num v-42">42&nbsp;</span>And many learned to believe in Jesus there.</span>

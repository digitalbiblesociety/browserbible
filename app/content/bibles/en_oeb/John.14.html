<span class="verse John_14_10" data-osis="John.14.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Don’t you believe that I am in union with the Father, and the Father with me?

<span class="verse John_14_17" data-osis="John.14.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">The world cannot receive this Spirit, because it does not see him or recognize him, but you recognize him, because he is always with you, and is within you.</span></span>

<span class="verse John_14_24" data-osis="John.14.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">The person who does not love me will not lay my message to heart; and the message to which you are listening is not my own, but comes from the Father who sent me.</span></span>
<span class="verse John_14_25" data-osis="John.14.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">I have told you all this while still with you,</span></span>
<span class="verse John_14_26" data-osis="John.14.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">but the helper — the Holy Spirit whom the Father will send in my name — will teach you all things, and will recall to your minds all that I have said to you.</span></span>
<span class="verse John_14_27" data-osis="John.14.27"><span class="verse-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Peace be with you! My own peace I give you. I do not give to you as the world gives. Do not let your hearts be troubled, or dismayed.</span></span>
<span class="verse John_14_28" data-osis="John.14.28"><span class="verse-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">You heard me say that I was going away and would return to you. Had you loved me, you would have been glad that I was going to the Father, because the Father is greater than I.</span></span>
<span class="verse John_14_29" data-osis="John.14.29"><span class="verse-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">And this I have told you now before it happens, so that, when it does happen, you may still believe in me.</span></span>
<span class="verse John_14_30" data-osis="John.14.30"><span class="verse-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">I will not talk with you much more, for the Spirit that is ruling the world is coming. He has nothing in common with me;</span></span>
<span class="verse John_14_31" data-osis="John.14.31"><span class="verse-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">but he is coming so that the world may see that I love the Father, and that I do as the Father commanded me. Come, let us be going.</span></span>

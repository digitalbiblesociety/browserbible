<p>
<span class="verse John_16_1" data-osis="John.16.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>I have spoken to you in this way so that you may not falter.</span>
<span class="verse John_16_2" data-osis="John.16.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">They will expel you from their Synagogues; indeed the time is coming when anyone who kills you will think that they are making an offering to God.</span></span>
<span class="verse John_16_3" data-osis="John.16.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">They will do this, because they have not learned to know the Father, or even me.</span></span>
<span class="verse John_16_4" data-osis="John.16.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">But I have spoken to you of these things so that, when the time for them comes, you may remember that I told you about them myself.</span></span>
<span class="verse John_16_5" data-osis="John.16.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">I did not tell you all this at first, because I was with you. But now I am to return to him who sent me; and yet not one of you asks me — ‘Where are you going?’</span></span>
<span class="verse John_16_6" data-osis="John.16.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Although your hearts are full of sorrow at all that I have been saying to you.</span></span>
<span class="verse John_16_7" data-osis="John.16.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Yet I am only telling you the truth; it is for your good that I should go away. For otherwise the helper will never come to you, but, if I leave you, I will send him to you.</span></span>
<span class="verse John_16_8" data-osis="John.16.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">And he, when he comes, will bring conviction to the world as to sin, and as to righteousness, and as to judgment;</span></span>
<span class="verse John_16_9" data-osis="John.16.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">as to sin, for people do not believe in me;</span></span>
<span class="verse John_16_10" data-osis="John.16.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">as to righteousness, for I am going to the Father, and you will see me no longer;</span></span>
<span class="verse John_16_11" data-osis="John.16.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">as to judgment, for the Spirit that is ruling this world has been condemned.</span></span>
<span class="verse John_16_12" data-osis="John.16.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">I have still much to say to you, but you cannot bear it now.</span></span>
<span class="verse John_16_13" data-osis="John.16.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Yet when he — The Spirit of truth — comes, he will guide you into all truth; for he will not speak on his own authority, but he will speak of all that he hears; and he will tell you of the things that are to come.</span></span>
<span class="verse John_16_14" data-osis="John.16.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">He will honor me; because he will take of what is mine, and will tell it to you.</span></span>
<span class="verse John_16_15" data-osis="John.16.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Everything that the Father has is mine; that is why I said that he takes of what is mine, and will tell it to you.</span></span>
<span class="verse John_16_16" data-osis="John.16.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">In a little while you will no longer see me; and then in a little while you will see me indeed.”</span></span>
<span class="verse John_16_17" data-osis="John.16.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>At this some of his disciples said to one another: “What does he mean by saying to us <span class="woc">‘In a little while you will not see me, and then in a little while you will see me indeed’;</span>and by saying <span class="woc">‘Because I am going to the Father’?</span></span>
<span class="verse John_16_18" data-osis="John.16.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>What does he mean by <span class="woc">‘In a little while’?”</span>they said; “we do not know what he is speaking about.”</span>
<span class="verse John_16_19" data-osis="John.16.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>Jesus saw that they were wanting to ask him a question, and said: <span class="woc">“Are you trying to find out from one another what I meant by saying ‘In a little while you will not see me; and then in a little while you will see me indeed’?</span></span>
<span class="verse John_16_20" data-osis="John.16.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">In truth I tell you that you will weep and mourn, but the world will rejoice; you will suffer pain, but your pain will turn to joy.</span></span>
<span class="verse John_16_21" data-osis="John.16.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">A woman in labor is in pain because her time has come; but no sooner is the child born, than she forgets her trouble in her joy that a child has been born into the world.</span></span>
<span class="verse John_16_22" data-osis="John.16.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">You, in the same way, are sorry now; but I will see you again, and your hearts will rejoice, and no one will rob you of your joy.</span></span>
<span class="verse John_16_23" data-osis="John.16.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">And at that time you will not ask me anything; in truth I tell you, if you ask the Father for anything, he will grant it to you in my name.</span></span>
<span class="verse John_16_24" data-osis="John.16.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">So far you have not asked for anything, in my name; ask, and you will receive, so that your joy may be complete.</span></span>
<span class="verse John_16_25" data-osis="John.16.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">I have spoken to you of all this in figures; a time is coming, however, when I will not speak any longer to you in figures, but will tell you about the Father plainly.</span></span>
<span class="verse John_16_26" data-osis="John.16.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">You will ask, at that time, in my name; and I do not say that I will intercede with the Father for you;</span></span>
<span class="verse John_16_27" data-osis="John.16.27"><span class="verse-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">for the Father himself loves you, because you have loved me, and have believed that I came from the Father.</span></span>
<span class="verse John_16_28" data-osis="John.16.28"><span class="verse-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">I came out from the Father, and have come into the world; and now I am to leave the world, and go to the Father.”</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_16_29" data-osis="John.16.29"><span class="verse-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span>“At last,” exclaimed the disciples, “you are using plain words and not speaking in figures at all.</span>
<span class="verse John_16_30" data-osis="John.16.30"><span class="verse-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span>Now we are sure that you know everything, and need not wait for anyone to question you. This makes us believe that you did come from God.”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_16_31" data-osis="John.16.31"><span class="verse-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">“Do you believe that already?”</span>Jesus answered.</span>
<span class="verse John_16_32" data-osis="John.16.32"><span class="verse-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">“Listen! A time is coming — indeed it has already come — when you are to be scattered, each going his own way, and to leave me alone; and yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me.</span></span>
<span class="verse John_16_33" data-osis="John.16.33"><span class="verse-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">I have spoken to you in this way, so that in me you may find peace. In the world you will find trouble; yet, take courage! I have conquered the world.”</span></span>

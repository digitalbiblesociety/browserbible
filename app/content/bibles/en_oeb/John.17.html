<span class="verse John_17_2" data-osis="John.17.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">even as you gave him power over all humanity, so that he should give eternal life to all those whom you has given him.</span></span>
<span class="verse John_17_3" data-osis="John.17.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">And the eternal life is this — to know you the one true God, and Jesus Christ whom you has sent as your messenger.</span></span>
<span class="verse John_17_4" data-osis="John.17.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">I have honored you on earth by completing the work which you has given me to do;</span></span>
<span class="verse John_17_5" data-osis="John.17.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">and now do you honor me, Father, at your own side, with the honor which I had at your side before the world began.</span></span>
<span class="verse John_17_6" data-osis="John.17.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">I have revealed you to those whom you gave me from the world; they were your own, and you gave them to me; and they have laid your message to heart.</span></span>
<span class="verse John_17_7" data-osis="John.17.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">They recognize now that everything that you gave me was from you;</span></span>
<span class="verse John_17_8" data-osis="John.17.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">for I have given them the teaching which you gave me, and they received it, and clearly understood that I came from you, and they believed that you has sent me as your messenger.</span></span>
<span class="verse John_17_9" data-osis="John.17.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">I intercede for them; I am not interceding for the world, but for those whom you has given me, for they are your own — </span></span>
<span class="verse John_17_10" data-osis="John.17.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">All that is mine is yours, and all that is yours is mine —  and I am honored in them.</span></span>

<span class="verse John_17_12" data-osis="John.17.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Whilst I was with them, I kept them by that revelation, and I have guarded them; and not one of them has been lost, except that lost soul — in fulfillment of scripture.</span></span>
<span class="verse John_17_13" data-osis="John.17.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">But now I am to come to you; and I am speaking like this, while still in the world, so that they may have my own joy, in all its fullness, in their hearts.</span></span>
<span class="verse John_17_14" data-osis="John.17.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">I have given them your message; and the world hated them, because they do not belong to the world, even as I do not belong to the world.</span></span>
<span class="verse John_17_15" data-osis="John.17.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">I do not ask you to take them out of the world, but to keep them from evil.</span></span>
<span class="verse John_17_16" data-osis="John.17.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">They do not belong to the world, even as I do not belong to the world.</span></span>
<span class="verse John_17_17" data-osis="John.17.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Consecrate them by the truth; your message is truth.</span></span>
<span class="verse John_17_18" data-osis="John.17.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Just as you has sent me as your messenger to the world, so I send them as my messengers to the world.</span></span>
<span class="verse John_17_19" data-osis="John.17.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">And it is for their sakes that I am consecrating myself, so that they also may be truly consecrated.</span></span>
<span class="verse John_17_20" data-osis="John.17.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">But it is not only for them that I am interceding, but also for those who believe in me through their message,</span></span>
<span class="verse John_17_21" data-osis="John.17.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">that they all may be one — that as you, Father, are in union with us — and so the world may believe that you have sent me as your messenger.</span></span>
<span class="verse John_17_22" data-osis="John.17.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">I have given them the honor which you has given me, so that they may be one as we are one — </span></span>
<span class="verse John_17_23" data-osis="John.17.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">I in union with them and you with me — that so they may be perfected in their union, and so that the world may know that you have sent me as your messenger, and that you have loved them as you have loved me.</span></span>
<span class="verse John_17_24" data-osis="John.17.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Father, my desire for all those whom you have given me is that they may be with me where I am, so that they may see the honor which you have given me; for thou did love me before the beginning of the world.</span></span>
<span class="verse John_17_25" data-osis="John.17.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Righteous Father, though the world did not know you, I knew you; and these people knew that you have sent me as your messenger.</span></span>
<span class="verse John_17_26" data-osis="John.17.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">I have made you known to them, and will do so still; that the love that you have had for me may be in their hearts, and that I may be in them also.”</span><br /><br /></span>

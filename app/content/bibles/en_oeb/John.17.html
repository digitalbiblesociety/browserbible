<span class="verse" data-osis="John.17.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>After saying this, Jesus raised his eyes heaven-wards, and said: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Father, the hour has come; honour thy Son, that thy Son may honour thee;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.17.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> even as thou gavest him power over all mankind, that he should give Immortal Life to all those whom thou has given him.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.17.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> And the Immortal Life is this &mdash; to know thee the one true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou has sent as thy Messenger.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.17.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> I have honoured thee on earth by completing the work which thou has given me to do;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.17.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> and now do thou honour me, Father, at thy own side, with the honour which I had at thy side before the world began.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.17.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> I have revealed thee to those whom thou gavest me from the world; they were thy own, and thou gavest them to me; and they have laid thy Message to heart.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.17.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> They recognise now that everything that thou gavest me was from thee;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.17.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> for I have given them the teaching which thou gavest me, and they received it, and clearly understood that I came from thee, and they believed that thou has sent me as thy Messenger.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.17.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> I intercede for them; I am not interceding for the world, but for those whom thou has given me, for they are thy own &mdash; </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.17.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> All that is mine is thine, and all that is thine is mine &mdash;  and I am honoured in them.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.17.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Now I am to be in this world no longer, but they are still to be in the world, and I am to come to thee. Holy Father, keep them by that revelation of thy Name which thou has given me, that they may be one, as we are.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.17.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Whilst I was with them, I kept them by that revelation, and I have guarded them; and not one of them has been lost, except that lost soul &mdash; in fulfilment of Scripture.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.17.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> But now I am to come to thee; and I am speaking thus, while still in the world, that they may have my own joy, in all its fullness, in their hearts.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.17.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> I have given them thy Message; and the world hated them, because they do not belong to the world, even as I do not belong to the world.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.17.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> I do not ask thee to take them out of the world, but to keep them from Evil.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.17.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> They do not belong to the world, even as I do not belong to the world.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.17.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Consecrate them by the Truth; thy Message is Truth.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.17.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Just as thou has sent me as thy Messenger to the world, so I send them as my Messengers to the world.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.17.19"><span class="verse-num">19&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> And it is for their sakes that I am consecrating myself, so that they also may be truly consecrated.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.17.20"><span class="verse-num">20&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> But it is not only for them that I am interceding, but also for those who believe in me through their Message,</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.17.21"><span class="verse-num">21&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> that they all may be one &mdash; that as thou, Father, art in union with us &mdash; and so the world may believe that thou hast sent me as thy Messenger.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.17.22"><span class="verse-num">22&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> I have given them the honour which thou has given me, that they may be one as we are one &mdash; </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.17.23"><span class="verse-num">23&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> I in union with them and thou with me &mdash; that so they may be perfected in their union, and thus the world may know that thou hast sent me as thy Messenger, and that thou has loved them as thou hast loved me.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.17.24"><span class="verse-num">24&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Father, my desire for all those whom thou has given me is that they may be with me where I am, so that they may see the honour which thou has given me; for thou didst love me before the beginning of the world.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.17.25"><span class="verse-num">25&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> O righteous Father, though the world did not know thee, I knew thee; and these men knew that thou has sent me as thy Messenger.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.17.26"><span class="verse-num">26&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> I have made thee known to them, and will do so still; that the love that thou has had for me may be in their hearts, and that I may be in them also.&rdquo;</span></span>

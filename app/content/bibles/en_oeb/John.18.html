<h2 class="chapter-num">18</h2>
<p>
<span class="verse John_18_1" data-osis="John.18.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>When Jesus had said this, he went out with his disciples and crossed the brook Kedron to a place where there was a garden, into which he and his disciples went.</span>
<span class="verse John_18_2" data-osis="John.18.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>The place was well known to Judas, the betrayer, for Jesus and his disciples had often met there.</span>
<span class="verse John_18_3" data-osis="John.18.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>So Judas, who had obtained the soldiers of the Roman garrison, and some police officers from the chief priests and the Pharisees, came there with lanterns, torches, and weapons.</span>
<span class="verse John_18_4" data-osis="John.18.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>Jesus, aware of all that was coming upon him, went to meet them, and said to them: <span class="woc">“For whom are you looking?”</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_18_5" data-osis="John.18.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>“Jesus of Nazareth,” was their answer. <span class="woc">“I am he,”</span>said Jesus. (Judas, the betrayer, was also standing with them.)</span>
<span class="verse John_18_6" data-osis="John.18.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>When Jesus said <span class="woc">‘I am he,’</span>they drew back and fell to the ground.</span>
<span class="verse John_18_7" data-osis="John.18.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>So he again asked for whom they were looking, and they answered: “Jesus of Nazareth.”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_18_8" data-osis="John.18.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">“I have already told you that I am he,”</span>replied Jesus, <span class="woc">“so, if it is for me that you are looking, let these people go.”</span></span>
<span class="verse John_18_9" data-osis="John.18.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>This was in fulfillment of his words — <span class="woc">‘Of those whom you have given me I have not lost one.’</span></span>
<span class="verse John_18_10" data-osis="John.18.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>At this, Simon Peter, who had a sword with him, drew it, and struck the high priest’s servant, and cut off his right ear. The servant’s name was Malchus.</span>
<span class="verse John_18_11" data-osis="John.18.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>But Jesus said to Peter: <span class="woc">“Sheathe your sword. Should I not drink the cup which the Father has given me?”</span></span>
<span class="verse John_18_12" data-osis="John.18.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>So the soldiers of the garrison, with their commanding officer and the Jewish police, arrested Jesus and bound him,</span>
<span class="verse John_18_13" data-osis="John.18.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>and took him first of all to Annas. Annas was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, who was high priest that year.</span>
<span class="verse John_18_14" data-osis="John.18.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>It was Caiaphas who had counseled the religious authorities, that it was best that one person should die for the people.</span>
<span class="verse John_18_15" data-osis="John.18.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>Meanwhile Simon Peter followed Jesus, and so did another disciple. That disciple, being well-known to the high priest, went with Jesus into the high priest’s courtyard,</span>
<span class="verse John_18_16" data-osis="John.18.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>while Peter stood outside by the door. Presently the other disciple — the one well-known to the high priest — went out and spoke to the portress, and brought Peter in.</span>
<span class="verse John_18_17" data-osis="John.18.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>So the maidservant said to Peter: “Aren’t you also one of this man’s disciples?”</span>
</p>
<p>“No, I am not,” he said.
<span class="verse John_18_18" data-osis="John.18.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>The servants and police officers were standing around a charcoal fire (which they had made because it was cold), and were warming themselves. Peter, too, was with them, standing and warming himself.</span>
<span class="verse John_18_19" data-osis="John.18.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>The high priest questioned Jesus about his disciples and about his teaching.</span>
<span class="verse John_18_20" data-osis="John.18.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">“For my part,”</span>answered Jesus, <span class="woc">“I have spoken to all the world openly. I always taught in some synagogue, or in the Temple Courts, places where everyone assembles, and I never spoke of anything in secret.</span></span>
<span class="verse John_18_21" data-osis="John.18.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Why question me? Question those who have listened to me as to what I have spoken about to them. They must know what I said.”</span></span>
<span class="verse John_18_22" data-osis="John.18.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>When Jesus said this, one of the police officers, who was standing near, gave him a blow with his hand. “Do you answer the high priest like that?” he exclaimed.</span>
<span class="verse John_18_23" data-osis="John.18.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">“If I said anything wrong, give evidence about it,”</span>replied Jesus; <span class="woc">“but if not, why do you strike me?”</span></span>
<span class="verse John_18_24" data-osis="John.18.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span>Annas sent him bound to Caiaphas the high priest.</span>
<span class="verse John_18_25" data-osis="John.18.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span>Meanwhile Simon Peter was standing there, warming himself; so they said to him: “Aren’t you also one of his disciples?” Peter denied it. “No, I am not,” he said.</span>
<span class="verse John_18_26" data-osis="John.18.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span>One of the high priest’s servants, a relation of the man whose ear Peter had cut off, exclaimed: “Did not I myself see you with him in the garden?”</span>
<span class="verse John_18_27" data-osis="John.18.27"><span class="verse-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span>Peter again denied it; and at that moment a cock crowed.</span>
<span class="verse John_18_28" data-osis="John.18.28"><span class="verse-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span>From Caiaphas they took Jesus to the Government house. It was early in the morning. But they did not enter the Government house themselves, otherwise they might become ‘defiled,’ and so be unable to eat the Passover.</span>
<span class="verse John_18_29" data-osis="John.18.29"><span class="verse-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span>Therefore Pilate came outside to speak to them. “What charge do you bring against this man?” he asked.</span>
<span class="verse John_18_30" data-osis="John.18.30"><span class="verse-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span>“If he had not been a criminal, we should not have given him up to you,” they answered.</span>
<span class="verse John_18_31" data-osis="John.18.31"><span class="verse-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span>“Take him yourselves,” said Pilate, “and try him by your own law.”</span>
</p>
<p>“We have no power to put anyone to death,” the authorities replied —
<span class="verse John_18_32" data-osis="John.18.32"><span class="verse-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span>In fulfillment of what Jesus had said when indicating the death that he was destined to die.</span>
<span class="verse John_18_33" data-osis="John.18.33"><span class="verse-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span>After that, Pilate went into the Government house again, and calling Jesus up, asked him: “Are you the king of the Jews?”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_18_34" data-osis="John.18.34"><span class="verse-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">“Do you ask me that yourself?”</span>replied Jesus, <span class="woc">“or did others say it to you about me?”</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_18_35" data-osis="John.18.35"><span class="verse-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span>“Do you take me for a Jew?” was Pilate’s answer. “It is your own nation and the chief priests who have given you up to me. What have you done?”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_18_36" data-osis="John.18.36"><span class="verse-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">“My kingly power,”</span>replied Jesus, <span class="woc">“is not due to this world. If it had been so, my servants would be doing their utmost to prevent my being given up to the authorities; but my kingly power is not from the world.”</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_18_37" data-osis="John.18.37"><span class="verse-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span>“So you are a king after all!” exclaimed Pilate. <span class="woc">“Yes, it is true I am a king,”</span>answered Jesus. <span class="woc">“I was born for this, I have come into the world for this — to bear testimony to the truth. Everyone who is on the side of truth listens to my voice.”</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_18_38" data-osis="John.18.38"><span class="verse-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span>“What is truth?” exclaimed Pilate. After saying this, he went out to the crowd again, and said: “For my part, I find nothing with which he can be charged.</span>
<span class="verse John_18_39" data-osis="John.18.39"><span class="verse-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span>It is, however, the custom for me to grant you the release of one man at the Passover Festival. Do you wish for the release of the king of the Jews?”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_18_40" data-osis="John.18.40"><span class="verse-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span>“No, not this man,” they shouted again, “but Barabbas!” This Barabbas was a robber.</span>

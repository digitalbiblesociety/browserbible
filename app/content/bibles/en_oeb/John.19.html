<h2 class="chapter-num">19</h2>
<p>
<span class="verse John_19_1" data-osis="John.19.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>After that, Pilate had Jesus scourged.</span>
<span class="verse John_19_2" data-osis="John.19.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>The soldiers made a crown with some thorns and put it on his head and threw a purple robe around him.</span>
<span class="verse John_19_3" data-osis="John.19.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>They kept coming up to him and saying: “Long live the king of the Jews!” and they gave him blow after blow with their hands.</span>
<span class="verse John_19_4" data-osis="John.19.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>Pilate again came outside, and said to the people: “Look! I am bringing him out to you, so that you may know that I find nothing with which he can be charged.”</span>
<span class="verse John_19_5" data-osis="John.19.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>Then Jesus came outside, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe; and Pilate said to them: “Here is the man!”</span>
<span class="verse John_19_6" data-osis="John.19.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>When the chief priests and the police officers saw him, they shouted: “Crucify him! Crucify him!”</span>
</p>
<p>“Take him yourselves and crucify him,” said Pilate. “For my part, I find nothing with which he can be charged.”
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_19_7" data-osis="John.19.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>“But we,” replied the crowd, “have a law, under which he deserves death for making himself out to be the Son of God.”</span>
<span class="verse John_19_8" data-osis="John.19.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>When Pilate heard what they said, he became still more alarmed;</span>
<span class="verse John_19_9" data-osis="John.19.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>and, going into the Government house again, he said to Jesus: “Where do you come from?”</span>
<span class="verse John_19_10" data-osis="John.19.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>But Jesus made no reply. So Pilate said to him: “Do you refuse to speak to me? Don’t you know that I have power to release you, and have power to crucify you?”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_19_11" data-osis="John.19.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">“You would have no power over me at all,”</span>answered Jesus, <span class="woc">“if it had not been given you from above; and, therefore, the man who betrayed me to you is guilty of the greater sin.”</span></span>
<span class="verse John_19_12" data-osis="John.19.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>This made Pilate anxious to release him; but the crowd shouted: “If you release that man, you are no friend of the Emperor! Anyone who makes himself out to be a king is setting himself against the Emperor!”</span>
<span class="verse John_19_13" data-osis="John.19.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>On hearing what they said, Pilate brought Jesus out, and took his seat on the Bench at a place called ‘The Stone Pavement’ — in Hebrew ‘Gabbatha.’</span>
<span class="verse John_19_14" data-osis="John.19.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>It was the Passover Preparation day, and about noon. Then he said to the crowd: “Here is your king!”</span>
<span class="verse John_19_15" data-osis="John.19.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>At that the people shouted: “Kill him! Kill him! Crucify him!”</span>
</p>
<p>“What! Should I crucify your king?” exclaimed Pilate. “We have no king but the Emperor,” replied the chief priests;
<span class="verse John_19_16" data-osis="John.19.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>so Pilate gave Jesus up to them to be crucified.</span>
<span class="verse John_19_17" data-osis="John.19.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>and he went out, carrying his cross himself, to the place which is named from a scull, or, in Hebrew, Golgotha.</span>
<span class="verse John_19_18" data-osis="John.19.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>There they crucified him, and two others with him — one on each side, and Jesus between them.</span>
<span class="verse John_19_19" data-osis="John.19.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>Pilate also had these words written and put up over the cross — ‘JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS.’</span>
<span class="verse John_19_20" data-osis="John.19.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>These words were read by many people, because the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city; and they were written in Hebrew, Latin and Greek.</span>
<span class="verse John_19_21" data-osis="John.19.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>The  chief priests said to Pilate: “Do not write ‘The king of the Jews’, but write what the man said — ‘I am the king of the Jews.’”</span>
<span class="verse John_19_22" data-osis="John.19.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>But Pilate answered: “What I have written, I have written.”</span>
<span class="verse John_19_23" data-osis="John.19.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>When the soldiers had crucified Jesus, they took his clothes and divided them into four shares — a share for each soldier — and they took the coat also. The coat had no seam, being woven in one piece from top to bottom.</span>
<span class="verse John_19_24" data-osis="John.19.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span>So they said to one another: “Do not let us tear it, but let us cast lots for it, to see who will have it.” This was in fulfillment of the words of scripture —<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘They shared my clothes among them,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And over my clothing they cast lots.’<br /><br />That was what the soldiers did.</span>
<span class="verse John_19_25" data-osis="John.19.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span>Meanwhile near the cross of Jesus were standing his mother and his mother’s sister, as well as Mary the wife of Clopas and Mary of Magdala.</span>
<span class="verse John_19_26" data-osis="John.19.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span>When Jesus saw his mother, and the disciple whom he loved, standing near, he said to his mother: <span class="woc">“There is your son.”</span></span>
<span class="verse John_19_27" data-osis="John.19.27"><span class="verse-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span>Then he said to that disciple: <span class="woc">“There is your mother.”</span>And from that very hour the disciple took her to live in his house.</span>
<span class="verse John_19_28" data-osis="John.19.28"><span class="verse-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span>Afterwards, knowing that everything was now finished, Jesus said, in fulfillment of the words of scripture: <span class="woc">“I am thirsty.”</span></span>
<span class="verse John_19_29" data-osis="John.19.29"><span class="verse-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span>There was a bowl standing there full of common wine; so they put a sponge soaked in the wine on the end of a hyssop-stalk, and held it up to his mouth.</span>
<span class="verse John_19_30" data-osis="John.19.30"><span class="verse-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span>When Jesus had received the wine, he exclaimed: <span class="woc">“All is finished!”</span>Then, bowing his head, he resigned his spirit to God.</span>
<span class="verse John_19_31" data-osis="John.19.31"><span class="verse-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span>It was the Preparation day, and so, to prevent the bodies from remaining on the crosses during the Sabbath (for that Sabbath was a great day), the Jews asked Pilate to have the legs broken and the bodies removed.</span>
<span class="verse John_19_32" data-osis="John.19.32"><span class="verse-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span>Accordingly the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first man, and then those of the other who had been crucified with Jesus;</span>
<span class="verse John_19_33" data-osis="John.19.33"><span class="verse-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span>but, on coming to him, when they saw that he was already dead, they did not break his legs.</span>
<span class="verse John_19_34" data-osis="John.19.34"><span class="verse-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span>One of the soldiers, however, pierced his side with a spear, and blood and water immediately flowed from it.</span>
<span class="verse John_19_35" data-osis="John.19.35"><span class="verse-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span>This is the statement of one who actually saw it — and his statement may be relied on, and he knows that he is speaking the truth — and it is given in order that you also may be convinced.</span>
<span class="verse John_19_36" data-osis="John.19.36"><span class="verse-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span>For all this happened in fulfillment of the words of scripture — ‘Not one of its bones will be broken.’</span>
<span class="verse John_19_37" data-osis="John.19.37"><span class="verse-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span>And there is another passage which says — ‘They will look on him whom they pierced.’</span>
<span class="verse John_19_38" data-osis="John.19.38"><span class="verse-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span>After this, Joseph of Ramah, a disciple of Jesus — but a secret one, owing to his fear of the religious authorities — begged Pilate’s permission to remove the body of Jesus. Pilate gave him leave; so Joseph went and removed the body.</span>
<span class="verse John_19_39" data-osis="John.19.39"><span class="verse-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span>Nicodemus, too — the man who had formerly visited Jesus by night — came with a roll of myrrh and aloes, weighing nearly a hundred pounds.</span>
<span class="verse John_19_40" data-osis="John.19.40"><span class="verse-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span>They took the body of Jesus, and wound it in linen with the spices, according to the Jewish mode of burial.</span>
<span class="verse John_19_41" data-osis="John.19.41"><span class="verse-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span>At the place where Jesus had been crucified there was a garden, and in the garden a newly made tomb in which no one had ever been laid.</span>
<span class="verse John_19_42" data-osis="John.19.42"><span class="verse-num v-42">42&nbsp;</span>And so, because of its being the Preparation day, and as the tomb was close at hand, they laid Jesus there.</span>

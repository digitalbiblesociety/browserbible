<h4>The Work in Judaea, Galilee and Samaria</h4>
<span class="verse John_2_1" data-osis="John.2.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>Two days after this there was a wedding at Cana in Galilee, and Jesus’ mother was there.</span>
<span class="verse John_2_2" data-osis="John.2.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>Jesus himself, too, with his disciples, was invited to the wedding.</span>
<span class="verse John_2_3" data-osis="John.2.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>And, when the wine ran short, his mother said to him: “They have no wine left.”</span>
<p>
<span class="verse John_2_4" data-osis="John.2.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">“What do you want with me?”</span>answered Jesus. <span class="woc">“My time has not come yet.”</span></span>
<span class="verse John_2_5" data-osis="John.2.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>His mother said to the servants: “Do whatever he tells you.”</span>
<span class="verse John_2_6" data-osis="John.2.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>There were standing there six stone water-jars, in accordance with the Jewish rule of ‘purification,’ each holding twenty or thirty gallons.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_2_7" data-osis="John.2.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>Jesus said to the servants: <span class="woc">“Fill the water-jars with water.”</span></span>
<span class="verse John_2_8" data-osis="John.2.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>And, when they had filled them to the brim, he added: <span class="woc">“Now take some out, and carry it to the Master of the feast.”</span>The servants did so.</span>
<span class="verse John_2_9" data-osis="John.2.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>And, when the Master of the feast had tasted the water which had now become wine, not knowing where it had come from — although the servants who had taken out the water knew —</span>
<span class="verse John_2_10" data-osis="John.2.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>He called the groom and said to him: “Everyone puts good wine on the table first, and inferior wine afterwards, when his guests have drunk freely; but you have kept back the good wine till now!”</span>
<span class="verse John_2_11" data-osis="John.2.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>This, the first sign of his mission, Jesus gave at Cana in Galilee, and by it revealed his glory; and his disciples believed in him.</span>
<span class="verse John_2_12" data-osis="John.2.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>After this, Jesus went down to Capernaum — he, his mother, his brothers, and his disciples; but they stayed there only a few days.</span>
<span class="verse John_2_13" data-osis="John.2.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>Then, as the Jewish Passover was near, Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</span>
<span class="verse John_2_14" data-osis="John.2.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>In the Temple Courts he found people who were selling bullocks, sheep, and pigeons, and the money changers at their counters.</span>
<span class="verse John_2_15" data-osis="John.2.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>So he made a whip of cords, and drove them all out of the Temple Courts, and the sheep and bullocks as well; he scattered the money of the money changers, and overturned their tables,</span>
<span class="verse John_2_16" data-osis="John.2.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>and said to the pigeon-dealers: <span class="woc">“Take these things away. Do not turn my Father’s house into a market house.”</span></span>
<span class="verse John_2_17" data-osis="John.2.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>His disciples remembered that scripture said — ‘Passion for your house will consume me.’</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_2_18" data-osis="John.2.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>Then some of the religious authorities asked Jesus: “What sign are you going to show us, since you act in this way?”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_2_19" data-osis="John.2.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">“Destroy this temple,”</span>was his answer, <span class="woc">“and I will raise it in three days.”</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_2_20" data-osis="John.2.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>“This Temple,” the authorities replied, “has been forty-six years in building, and are you going to ‘raise it in three days’?”</span>
<span class="verse John_2_21" data-osis="John.2.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>But Jesus was speaking of his body as a temple.</span>
<span class="verse John_2_22" data-osis="John.2.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>Afterwards, when he had risen from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this; and they believed the passage of scripture, and the words which Jesus had spoken.</span>
<span class="verse John_2_23" data-osis="John.2.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>While Jesus was in Jerusalem, during the Passover Festival, many came to trust in him, when they saw the signs of his mission that he was giving.</span>
<span class="verse John_2_24" data-osis="John.2.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span>But Jesus did not put himself in their power because he knew what was in their hearts.</span>
<span class="verse John_2_25" data-osis="John.2.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span>He did not need anyone to tell him about people because he could read what was in them..</span>

<h4>The Risen Life</h4>
<span class="verse John_20_1" data-osis="John.20.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>On the first day of the week, early in the morning, while it was still dark, Mary of Magdala went to the tomb, and saw that the stone had been removed.</span>
<span class="verse John_20_2" data-osis="John.20.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>So she came running to Simon Peter, and to that other disciple who was Jesus’ friend, and said to them: “They have taken away the Master out of the tomb, and we do not know where they have laid him!”</span>
<span class="verse John_20_3" data-osis="John.20.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>So, Peter started off with that other disciple, and they went to the tomb.</span>
<span class="verse John_20_4" data-osis="John.20.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>The two began running together; but the other disciple ran faster than Peter, and reached the tomb first.</span>
<span class="verse John_20_5" data-osis="John.20.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>Stooping down, he saw the linen wrappings lying there, but did not go in.</span>
<span class="verse John_20_6" data-osis="John.20.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>Presently Simon Peter came following behind him, and went into the tomb; and he looked at the linen wrappings lying there,</span>
<span class="verse John_20_7" data-osis="John.20.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>and the cloth which had been on Jesus’ head, not lying with the wrappings, but rolled up on one side, separately.</span>
<span class="verse John_20_8" data-osis="John.20.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>Then the other disciple, who had reached the tomb first, went inside too, and he saw for himself and was convinced.</span>
<span class="verse John_20_9" data-osis="John.20.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>For they did not then understand the passage of scripture which says that Jesus must rise again from the dead.</span>
<span class="verse John_20_10" data-osis="John.20.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>The disciples then returned to their companions.</span>
<p>
<span class="verse John_20_11" data-osis="John.20.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>Meanwhile Mary was standing close outside the tomb, weeping. Still weeping, she leant forward into the tomb,</span>
<span class="verse John_20_12" data-osis="John.20.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>and perceived two angels clothed in white sitting there, where the body of Jesus had been lying, one where the head and the other where the feet had been.</span>
<span class="verse John_20_13" data-osis="John.20.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>“Why are you weeping?” asked the angels. “They have taken my Master away,” she answered, “and I do not know where they have laid him.”</span>
<span class="verse John_20_14" data-osis="John.20.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>After saying this, she turned around, and looked at Jesus standing there, but she did not know that it was Jesus.</span>
<span class="verse John_20_15" data-osis="John.20.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">“Why are you weeping? Whom are you seeking?”</span>he asked. Supposing him to be the gardener, Mary answered: “If it was you, Sir, who carried him away, tell me where you have laid him, and I will take him away myself.”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_20_16" data-osis="John.20.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">“Mary!”</span>said Jesus. She turned around, and exclaimed in Hebrew: “Rabboni!” (or, as we should say, ‘teacher’).</span>
<span class="verse John_20_17" data-osis="John.20.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">“Do not hold me,”</span>Jesus said; <span class="woc">“for I have not yet ascended to the Father. But go to my brothers, and tell them that I am ascending to him who is my Father and their Father, my God and their God.”</span></span>
<span class="verse John_20_18" data-osis="John.20.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>Mary of Magdala went and told the disciples that she had seen the Master, and that he had said this to her.</span>
<span class="verse John_20_19" data-osis="John.20.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>In the evening of the same day — the first day of the week —  after the doors of the room, in which the disciples were, had been shut because they were afraid of the religious authorities, Jesus came and stood among them and said: <span class="woc">“Peace be with you”;</span></span>
<span class="verse John_20_20" data-osis="John.20.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>after which he showed them his hands and his side. The disciples were filled with joy when they saw the Master.</span>
<span class="verse John_20_21" data-osis="John.20.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>Again Jesus said to them: <span class="woc">“Peace be with you. As the Father has sent me as his messenger, so I am sending you.”</span></span>
<span class="verse John_20_22" data-osis="John.20.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>After saying this, he breathed on them, and said: <span class="woc">“Receive the Holy Spirit;</span></span>
<span class="verse John_20_23" data-osis="John.20.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">if you remit anyone’s sins, they have been remitted; and, if you retain them, they have been retained.”</span></span>
<span class="verse John_20_24" data-osis="John.20.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span>But Thomas, one of the Twelve, called ‘The Twin,’ was not with them when Jesus came;</span>
<span class="verse John_20_25" data-osis="John.20.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span>so the rest of the disciples said to him: “We have seen the Master!”</span>
</p>
<p>“Unless I see the marks of the nails in his hands,” he exclaimed, “and put my finger into the marks, and put my hand into his side, I will not believe it.”
<span class="verse John_20_26" data-osis="John.20.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span>A week later the disciples were again in the house, and Thomas with them. After the doors had been shut, Jesus came and stood among them, and said: <span class="woc">“Peace be with you.”</span></span>
<span class="verse John_20_27" data-osis="John.20.27"><span class="verse-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span>Then he said to Thomas: <span class="woc">“Place your finger here, and look at my hands; and place your hand here, and put it into my side; and do not refuse to believe, but believe.”</span></span>
<span class="verse John_20_28" data-osis="John.20.28"><span class="verse-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span>And Thomas exclaimed: “My Master, and my God!”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_20_29" data-osis="John.20.29"><span class="verse-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">“Is it because you have seen me that you have believed?”</span>said Jesus. <span class="woc">“Blessed are they who have not seen, and yet have believed!”</span></span>
<span class="verse John_20_30" data-osis="John.20.30"><span class="verse-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span>There were many other signs of his mission that Jesus gave in presence of the disciples, which are not recorded in this book;</span>
<span class="verse John_20_31" data-osis="John.20.31"><span class="verse-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span>but these have been recorded so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God — and that, through your belief in his name, you may have life.</span>

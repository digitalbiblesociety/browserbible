<h2 class="chapter-num">21</h2>
<p>
<span class="verse John_21_1" data-osis="John.21.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>Later on, Jesus showed himself again to the disciples by the Sea of Tiberias.</span>
<span class="verse John_21_2" data-osis="John.21.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>It was in this way: — Simon Peter, Thomas, who was called ‘The Twin,’ Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, Zebedee’s sons, and two other disciples of Jesus, were together, when Simon Peter said:</span>
<span class="verse John_21_3" data-osis="John.21.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>“I am going fishing.”</span>
</p>
<p>“We will come with you,” said the others. They went out and got into the boat, but caught nothing that night.
<span class="verse John_21_4" data-osis="John.21.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>Just as day was breaking, Jesus came and stood on the beach; but the disciples did not know that it was he.</span>
<span class="verse John_21_5" data-osis="John.21.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">“My children,”</span>he said, <span class="woc">“have you anything to eat?”</span></span>
</p>
<p>“No,” they answered.
<span class="verse John_21_6" data-osis="John.21.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">“Cast your net to the right of the boat,”</span>he said, <span class="woc">“and you will find fish.”</span>So they cast the net, and now they could not haul it in because of the quantity of fish.</span>
<span class="verse John_21_7" data-osis="John.21.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>The disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter: “It is the Master!” When Simon Peter heard that it was the Master, he fastened his coat around him (for he had taken it off), and threw himself into the Sea.</span>
<span class="verse John_21_8" data-osis="John.21.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>But the rest of the disciples came in the boat (for they were only about a hundred yards from shore), dragging the net full of fish.</span>
<span class="verse John_21_9" data-osis="John.21.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>When they had come ashore, they found a charcoal fire ready, with some fish already on it, and some bread as well.</span>
<span class="verse John_21_10" data-osis="John.21.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">“Bring some of the fish which you have just caught,”</span>said Jesus.</span>
<span class="verse John_21_11" data-osis="John.21.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>So Simon Peter got into the boat and hauled the net ashore full of large fish, a hundred and fifty-three of them; and yet, although there were so many, the net had not been torn.</span>
<span class="verse John_21_12" data-osis="John.21.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>And Jesus said to them: <span class="woc">“Come and breakfast.”</span>Not one of the disciples ventured to ask him who he was, knowing that it was the Master.</span>
<span class="verse John_21_13" data-osis="John.21.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>Jesus went and took the bread and gave it to them, and the fish too.</span>
<span class="verse John_21_14" data-osis="John.21.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>This was the third time that Jesus showed himself to the disciples after he had risen from the dead.</span>
<span class="verse John_21_15" data-osis="John.21.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>When breakfast was over, Jesus said to Simon Peter: <span class="woc">“Simon, son of John, do you love me more than the others?”</span></span>
</p>
<p>“Yes, Master,” he answered, “you know that I am your friend.”
</p>
<p><span class="woc">“Feed my lambs,”</span>said Jesus.
<span class="verse John_21_16" data-osis="John.21.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>Then, a second time, Jesus asked: <span class="woc">“Simon, son of John, do you love me?”</span></span>
</p>
<p>“Yes, Master,” he answered, “you know that I am your friend.”
</p>
<p><span class="woc">“Tend my sheep,”</span>said Jesus.
<span class="verse John_21_17" data-osis="John.21.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>The third time, Jesus said to him: <span class="woc">“Simon, son of John, are you my friend?”</span>Peter was hurt at his third question being ‘Are you my friend?’; and exclaimed: “Master, you know everything! You can tell that I am your friend.”</span>
</p>
<p><span class="woc">“Feed my sheep,”</span>said Jesus.
<span class="verse John_21_18" data-osis="John.21.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">“In truth I tell you,” he continued, “when you were young, you used to put on your own clothes, and walk wherever you wished; but, when you have grown old, you will have to stretch out your hands, while some one else puts on your clothes, and takes you where you do not wish.”</span></span>
<span class="verse John_21_19" data-osis="John.21.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>Jesus said this to show the death by which Peter was to honor God, and then he added: <span class="woc">“Follow me.”</span></span>
<span class="verse John_21_20" data-osis="John.21.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>Peter turned around, and saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following — the one who at the supper leant back on the Master’s shoulder, and asked him who it was who would betray him.</span>
<span class="verse John_21_21" data-osis="John.21.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>Seeing him, Peter said to Jesus: “Master, what about this man?”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_21_22" data-osis="John.21.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">“If it is my will that he should wait until I come,”</span>answered Jesus, <span class="woc">“what has that to do with you? Follow me yourself.”</span></span>
<span class="verse John_21_23" data-osis="John.21.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>So the report spread among his followers that that disciple was not to die; yet Jesus did not say that he was not to die, but said <span class="woc">“If it is my will that he should wait until I come, what has that to do with you?”</span></span>
<span class="verse John_21_24" data-osis="John.21.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span>It is this disciple who states these things, and who recorded them; and we know that his statement is true.</span>
<span class="verse John_21_25" data-osis="John.21.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span>There are many other things which Jesus did; but, if every one of them were to be recorded in detail, I suppose that even the world itself would not hold the books that would be written.</span>

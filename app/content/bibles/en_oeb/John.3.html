<h2 class="chapter-num">3</h2>
<p>
<span class="verse John_3_1" data-osis="John.3.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>Now there was a Pharisee named Nicodemus, who was a leading man among his people.</span>
<span class="verse John_3_2" data-osis="John.3.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>This man came to Jesus by night, and said to him: “Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher come from God; for no one could give such signs as you are giving, unless God were with him.”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_3_3" data-osis="John.3.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">“In truth I tell you,”</span>exclaimed Jesus, <span class="woc">“unless a person is reborn, they cannot see the kingdom of God.”</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_3_4" data-osis="John.3.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>“How can a person,” asked Nicodemus, “be born when they are old? Can they be born a second time?”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_3_5" data-osis="John.3.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">“In truth I tell you,”</span>answered Jesus, <span class="woc">“unless a person owes their birth to water and Spirit, they cannot enter the kingdom of God.</span></span>
<span class="verse John_3_6" data-osis="John.3.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">All that owes its birth to human nature is human, and all that owes its birth to the Spirit is spiritual.</span></span>
<span class="verse John_3_7" data-osis="John.3.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Do not wonder at my telling you that you all need to be reborn.</span></span>
<span class="verse John_3_8" data-osis="John.3.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">The wind blows wherever it wants, and you can hear the sound it makes, but you do not know where it comes from, or where it goes; it is the same with everyone who owes his birth to the Spirit.”</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_3_9" data-osis="John.3.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>“How can that be?” asked Nicodemus.</span>
<span class="verse John_3_10" data-osis="John.3.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">“What! You a teacher of Israel,”</span>exclaimed Jesus, <span class="woc">“and yet do not understand this!</span></span>
<span class="verse John_3_11" data-osis="John.3.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">In truth I tell you that we speak of what we know, and state what we have seen; and yet you do not accept our statements.</span></span>
<span class="verse John_3_12" data-osis="John.3.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">If, when I tell you earthly things, you do not believe me, how will you believe me when I tell you of heavenly things?</span></span>
<span class="verse John_3_13" data-osis="John.3.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">No one has ascended to heaven, except him who descended from heaven — the Son of Man himself.</span></span>
<span class="verse John_3_14" data-osis="John.3.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">And, as Moses lifted up the snake{A bronze snake on a pole, see Num 21:9}. in the desert, so must the Son of Man be lifted up;</span></span>
<span class="verse John_3_15" data-osis="John.3.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">so that everyone who believes in him may have eternal life.”</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_3_16" data-osis="John.3.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, so that everyone who believes in him may not be lost, but have eternal life.</span></span>
<span class="verse John_3_17" data-osis="John.3.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but so that the world might be saved through him.</span></span>
<span class="verse John_3_18" data-osis="John.3.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">The person who believes in him escapes condemnation, while the person who does not believe in him is already condemned, because they have not believed in the only Son of God.</span></span>
<span class="verse John_3_19" data-osis="John.3.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">The ground of their condemnation is this, that though the light has come into the world, people preferred the darkness to the light, because their actions were wicked.</span></span>
<span class="verse John_3_20" data-osis="John.3.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">For the person who lives an evil life hates the light, and will not come to it, fearing that their actions will be exposed;</span></span>
<span class="verse John_3_21" data-osis="John.3.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">but the person who lives by the truth comes into the light, so it can be clearly seen that God is in all they do.</span></span>
<span class="verse John_3_22" data-osis="John.3.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>After this, Jesus went with his disciples into the country parts of Judea; and there he stayed with them, and baptized.</span>
<span class="verse John_3_23" data-osis="John.3.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>John, also, was baptizing at Aenon near Salim, because there were many streams there; and people were constantly coming and being baptized.</span>
<span class="verse John_3_24" data-osis="John.3.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span>(For John had not yet been imprisoned).</span>
<span class="verse John_3_25" data-osis="John.3.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span>Now a discussion arose between some of John’s disciples and a fellow Jew on the subject of ‘purification;’</span>
<span class="verse John_3_26" data-osis="John.3.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span>and the disciples came to John and said: “Rabbi, the man who was with you on the other side of the Jordan, and to whom you have yourself borne testimony — he, also, is baptizing, and everybody is going to him.”</span>
<span class="verse John_3_27" data-osis="John.3.27"><span class="verse-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span>John’s answer was — “A person can gain nothing but what is given them from heaven.</span>
<span class="verse John_3_28" data-osis="John.3.28"><span class="verse-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span>You are yourselves witnesses that I said ‘I am not the Christ,’ but ‘I have been sent before him as a messenger.’</span>
<span class="verse John_3_29" data-osis="John.3.29"><span class="verse-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span>It is the groom who has the bride; but the groom’s friend, who stands by and listens to him, is filled with joy when he hears the groom’s voice. This joy I have felt to the full.</span>
<span class="verse John_3_30" data-osis="John.3.30"><span class="verse-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span>He must become greater, and I less.”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_3_31" data-osis="John.3.31"><span class="verse-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span>He who comes from above is above all others; but a child of earth is earthly, and his teaching is earthly, too. He who comes from heaven is above all others.</span>
<span class="verse John_3_32" data-osis="John.3.32"><span class="verse-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span>He states what he has seen and what he heard, and yet no one accepts his statement.</span>
<span class="verse John_3_33" data-osis="John.3.33"><span class="verse-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span>They who did accept his statement confirm the fact that God is true.</span>
<span class="verse John_3_34" data-osis="John.3.34"><span class="verse-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span>For he whom God sent as his messenger gives us God’s own teaching, for God does not limit the gift of the Spirit.</span>
<span class="verse John_3_35" data-osis="John.3.35"><span class="verse-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span>The Father loves his Son, and has put everything in his hands.</span>
<span class="verse John_3_36" data-osis="John.3.36"><span class="verse-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span>The person who believes in the Son has eternal life, while a person who rejects the Son will not even see that life, but remains under ‘God’s displeasure.’</span>

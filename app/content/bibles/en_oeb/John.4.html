<h2 class="chapter-num">4</h2>
<p>
<span class="verse John_4_1" data-osis="John.4.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>Now, when the Master heard that the Pharisees had been told that he was making and baptizing more disciples than John</span>
<span class="verse John_4_2" data-osis="John.4.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>(Though it was not Jesus himself, but his disciples, who baptized),</span>
<span class="verse John_4_3" data-osis="John.4.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>he left Judea, and set out again for Galilee.</span>
<span class="verse John_4_4" data-osis="John.4.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>He had to pass through Samaria,</span>
<span class="verse John_4_5" data-osis="John.4.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>and, on his way, he came to a Samaritan town called Shechem, near the plot of land that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.</span>
<span class="verse John_4_6" data-osis="John.4.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>Jacob’s Spring was there, and Jesus, being tired after his journey, sat down beside the spring, just as he was. It was then about midday.</span>
<span class="verse John_4_7" data-osis="John.4.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>A woman of Samaria came to draw water; and Jesus said to her — <span class="woc">“Give me some to drink,”</span></span>
<span class="verse John_4_8" data-osis="John.4.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>For his disciples had gone into the town to buy food.</span>
<span class="verse John_4_9" data-osis="John.4.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>“How is it,” replied the Samaritan woman, “that you who are a Jew ask for water from a Samaritan woman like me?” (For Jews do not associate with Samaritans).</span>
<span class="verse John_4_10" data-osis="John.4.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">“If you knew of the gift of God,”</span>replied Jesus, <span class="woc">“and who it is that is saying to you ‘Give me some water,’ you would have asked him, and he would have given you ‘living water’.”</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_4_11" data-osis="John.4.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>“You have no bucket, Sir, and the well is deep,” she said; “where did you get that ‘living water?’</span>
<span class="verse John_4_12" data-osis="John.4.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>Surely you are not greater than our ancestor Jacob who gave us the well, and used to drink from it himself, and his sons, and his cattle!”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_4_13" data-osis="John.4.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">“All who drink of this water,”</span>replied Jesus, <span class="woc">“will be thirsty again;</span></span>
<span class="verse John_4_14" data-osis="John.4.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">but whoever once drinks of the water that I will give him will never thirst any more; but the water that I will give him will become a spring welling up within him — a source of eternal life.”</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_4_15" data-osis="John.4.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>“Give me this water, Sir,” said the woman, “so that I may not be thirsty, nor have to come all the way here to draw water.”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_4_16" data-osis="John.4.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">“Go and call your husband,”</span>said Jesus, <span class="woc">“and then come back.”</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_4_17" data-osis="John.4.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>“I have no husband,” answered the woman. <span class="woc">“You are right in saying ‘I have no husband,’”</span>replied Jesus,</span>
<span class="verse John_4_18" data-osis="John.4.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">“For you have had five husbands, and the man with whom you are now living is not your husband; in saying that, you have spoken the truth.”</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_4_19" data-osis="John.4.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>“I see, Sir, that you are a prophet!” exclaimed the woman.</span>
<span class="verse John_4_20" data-osis="John.4.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>“It was on this mountain that our ancestors worshiped; and yet you Jews say that the proper place for worship is in Jerusalem.”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_4_21" data-osis="John.4.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">“Believe me,”</span>replied Jesus, <span class="woc">“a time is coming when it will be neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem that you will worship the Father.</span></span>
<span class="verse John_4_22" data-osis="John.4.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">You Samaritans do not know what you worship; we know what we worship, for salvation comes from the Jews.</span></span>
<span class="verse John_4_23" data-osis="John.4.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">But a time is coming, indeed it is already here, when the true worshipers will worship the Father spiritually and truly; for such are the worshipers that the Father desires.</span></span>
<span class="verse John_4_24" data-osis="John.4.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">God is Spirit; and those who worship him must worship spiritually and truly.”</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_4_25" data-osis="John.4.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span>“I know,” answered the woman, “that the Messiah, who is called the Christ, is coming; when once he has come, he will tell us everything.”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_4_26" data-osis="John.4.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">“I am he,”</span>Jesus said to her, <span class="woc">“I who am speaking to you.”</span></span>
<span class="verse John_4_27" data-osis="John.4.27"><span class="verse-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span>At this moment his disciples came up, and were surprised to find him talking with a woman; but none of them asked ‘What do you want?’ or ‘Why are you talking with her?’</span>
<span class="verse John_4_28" data-osis="John.4.28"><span class="verse-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span>So the woman, leaving her pitcher, went back to the town, and said to the people:</span>
<span class="verse John_4_29" data-osis="John.4.29"><span class="verse-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span>“Come and see someone who has told me everything that I have done. Can he be the Christ?”</span>
<span class="verse John_4_30" data-osis="John.4.30"><span class="verse-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span>And the people left the town and went to see Jesus.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_4_31" data-osis="John.4.31"><span class="verse-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span>Meanwhile the disciples kept saying to him: “Take something to eat, Rabbi.”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_4_32" data-osis="John.4.32"><span class="verse-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">“I have food to eat,”</span>he answered, <span class="woc">“of which you know nothing.”</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_4_33" data-osis="John.4.33"><span class="verse-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span>“Can anyone have brought him anything to eat?” the disciples said to one another.</span>
<span class="verse John_4_34" data-osis="John.4.34"><span class="verse-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">“My food,”</span>replied Jesus, <span class="woc">“is to do the will of him who sent me, and to complete his work.</span></span>
<span class="verse John_4_35" data-osis="John.4.35"><span class="verse-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Don’t you say that it still wants four months to harvest? Why, look up, and see how white the fields are for harvest!</span></span>
<span class="verse John_4_36" data-osis="John.4.36"><span class="verse-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Already the reaper is receiving wages and gathering in sheaves for eternal life, so that sower and reaper rejoice together.</span></span>
<span class="verse John_4_37" data-osis="John.4.37"><span class="verse-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">For here the proverb holds good — ‘One sows, another reaps.’</span></span>
<span class="verse John_4_38" data-osis="John.4.38"><span class="verse-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">I have sent you to reap that on which you have spent no labor; others have labored, and you have reaped the results of their labor.”</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_4_39" data-osis="John.4.39"><span class="verse-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span>Many from that town came to believe in Jesus — Samaritans though they were — because the woman had said: ‘He has told me everything that I have done.’</span>
<span class="verse John_4_40" data-osis="John.4.40"><span class="verse-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span>And, when these Samaritans had come to Jesus, they begged him to stay with them, and he stayed there two days.</span>
<span class="verse John_4_41" data-osis="John.4.41"><span class="verse-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span>But far more came to believe in him because of what he said himself,</span>
<span class="verse John_4_42" data-osis="John.4.42"><span class="verse-num v-42">42&nbsp;</span>and they said to the woman: “It is no longer because of what you say that we believe in him, for we have heard him ourselves and know that he really is the Savior of the world.”</span>
<span class="verse John_4_43" data-osis="John.4.43"><span class="verse-num v-43">43&nbsp;</span>After these two days Jesus went on to Galilee;</span>
<span class="verse John_4_44" data-osis="John.4.44"><span class="verse-num v-44">44&nbsp;</span>for he himself declared that ‘a prophet is not honored in his own country.’</span>
<span class="verse John_4_45" data-osis="John.4.45"><span class="verse-num v-45">45&nbsp;</span>When he entered Galilee, the Galileans welcomed him, for they had seen all that he did at Jerusalem during the Festival, at which they also had been present.</span>
<span class="verse John_4_46" data-osis="John.4.46"><span class="verse-num v-46">46&nbsp;</span>So Jesus came again to Cana in Galilee, where he had turned the water into wine. Now there was one of the king’s officers whose son was lying ill at Capernaum.</span>
<span class="verse John_4_47" data-osis="John.4.47"><span class="verse-num v-47">47&nbsp;</span>When this man heard that Jesus had returned from Judea to Galilee, he went to him, and begged him to come down and cure his son; for he was at the point of death.</span>
<span class="verse John_4_48" data-osis="John.4.48"><span class="verse-num v-48">48&nbsp;</span>Jesus answered: <span class="woc">“Unless you all see signs and wonders, you will not believe.”</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_4_49" data-osis="John.4.49"><span class="verse-num v-49">49&nbsp;</span>“Sir,” said the officer, “come down before my child dies.” And Jesus answered: “Go, your son is living.”</span>
<span class="verse John_4_50" data-osis="John.4.50"><span class="verse-num v-50">50&nbsp;</span>The man believed what Jesus said to him, and went;</span>
<span class="verse John_4_51" data-osis="John.4.51"><span class="verse-num v-51">51&nbsp;</span>and, while he was on his way down, his servants met him, and told him that his child was living.</span>
<span class="verse John_4_52" data-osis="John.4.52"><span class="verse-num v-52">52&nbsp;</span>So he asked them at what time the boy began to get better. “It was yesterday, about one o’clock,” they said, “that the fever left him.”</span>
<span class="verse John_4_53" data-osis="John.4.53"><span class="verse-num v-53">53&nbsp;</span>By this the father knew that it was at the very time when Jesus had said to him <span class="woc">‘Your son is living’</span>; and he himself, with all his household, believed in Jesus.</span>
<span class="verse John_4_54" data-osis="John.4.54"><span class="verse-num v-54">54&nbsp;</span>This was the second occasion on which Jesus gave a sign of his mission on coming from Judea to Galilee.</span>

<h2 class="chapter-num">7</h2>
<p>
<span class="verse John_7_1" data-osis="John.7.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>After this, Jesus went about in Galilee, for he would not do so in Judea, because the religious authorities (in Jerusalem) were eager to put him to death.</span>
<span class="verse John_7_2" data-osis="John.7.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>When the Jewish Festival of Tabernacles was near,</span>
<span class="verse John_7_3" data-osis="John.7.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>his brothers said to him: “Leave this part of the country, and go into Judea, so that your disciples, as well as we, may see the work that you are doing.</span>
<span class="verse John_7_4" data-osis="John.7.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>For no one does a thing privately, if they are seeking to be widely known. Since you do these things, you should show yourself publicly to the world.”</span>
<span class="verse John_7_5" data-osis="John.7.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>For even his brothers did not believe in him.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_7_6" data-osis="John.7.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">“My time,”</span>answered Jesus, <span class="woc">“is not come yet, but your time is always here.</span></span>
<span class="verse John_7_7" data-osis="John.7.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">The world cannot hate you, but it does hate me, because I testify that its ways are evil.</span></span>
<span class="verse John_7_8" data-osis="John.7.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Go yourselves up to the Festival; I am not going to this Festival yet, because my time has not yet come.”</span></span>
<span class="verse John_7_9" data-osis="John.7.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>After telling them this, he stayed on in Galilee.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_7_10" data-osis="John.7.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>But, when his brothers had gone up to the Festival, Jesus also went up — not publicly, but privately.</span>
<span class="verse John_7_11" data-osis="John.7.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>The authorities were looking for him at the Festival and asking ‘Where is he?’;</span>
<span class="verse John_7_12" data-osis="John.7.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>and there were many whispers about him among the people, some saying ‘He is a good man;’ others: ‘No! He is leading the people astray.’</span>
<span class="verse John_7_13" data-osis="John.7.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>No one, however, spoke freely about him, because they were afraid of the authoritites.</span>
<span class="verse John_7_14" data-osis="John.7.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>About the middle of the Festival week, Jesus went up into the Temple Courts, and began teaching.</span>
<span class="verse John_7_15" data-osis="John.7.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>The authorities were astonished. “How has this man got his learning,” they asked, “when he has never studied?”</span>
<span class="verse John_7_16" data-osis="John.7.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>So, in reply, Jesus said: <span class="woc">“My teaching is not my own; it is his who sent me.</span></span>
<span class="verse John_7_17" data-osis="John.7.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">If anyone has the will to do God’s will, they will find out whether my teaching is from God, or whether I speak on my own authority.</span></span>
<span class="verse John_7_18" data-osis="John.7.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">The person who speaks on their own authority seeks honor for themselves; but the person who seeks the honor of him that sent him is sincere, and there is nothing false in him.</span></span>
<span class="verse John_7_19" data-osis="John.7.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Was not it Moses who gave you the law? Yet not one of you obeys it! Why are you seeking to put me to death?”</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_7_20" data-osis="John.7.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>“You must be possessed by a demon!” the people exclaimed. “Who is seeking to put you to death?”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_7_21" data-osis="John.7.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">“There was one thing I did,”</span>replied Jesus, <span class="woc">“at which you are all still wondering.</span></span>
<span class="verse John_7_22" data-osis="John.7.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>“Is he going to kill himself,” they exclaimed, “that he says — <span class="woc">‘You cannot go where I am going’?”</span></span>
<span class="verse John_7_23" data-osis="John.7.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">When a man receives circumcision on a Sabbath to prevent the law of Moses from being broken, how can you be angry with me for making a man sound and well on a Sabbath?</span></span>
<span class="verse John_7_24" data-osis="John.7.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Do not judge by appearances; judge justly.”</span></span>
<span class="verse John_7_25" data-osis="John.7.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span>At this some of the people of Jerusalem exclaimed: “Is not this the man who they are seeking to put to death?</span>
<span class="verse John_7_26" data-osis="John.7.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span>Yet here he is, speaking out boldly, and they say nothing to him! Is it possible that our leading men have really discovered that he is the Christ?</span>
<span class="verse John_7_27" data-osis="John.7.27"><span class="verse-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span>Yet we know where this man is from; but, when the Christ comes, no one will be able to tell where he is from.”</span>
<span class="verse John_7_28" data-osis="John.7.28"><span class="verse-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span>Therefore, Jesus, as he was teaching in the Temple Courts, raised his voice and said: <span class="woc">“Yes; you know me and you know where I am from. Yet I have not come on my own authority, but he who sent me may be trusted; and him you do not know.</span></span>
<span class="verse John_7_29" data-osis="John.7.29"><span class="verse-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">I do know him, for it is from him that I have come, and he sent me as his messenger.”</span></span>
<span class="verse John_7_30" data-osis="John.7.30"><span class="verse-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span>So they sought to arrest him; but no one touched him, for his time was not come yet.</span>
<span class="verse John_7_31" data-osis="John.7.31"><span class="verse-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span>Many of the people, however, believed in him. “When the Christ comes,” they said, “will he give more signs of his mission than this man has given?”</span>
<span class="verse John_7_32" data-osis="John.7.32"><span class="verse-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span>The Pharisees heard the people whispering about him in this way, and so the chief priests and the Pharisees sent officers to arrest him;</span>
<span class="verse John_7_33" data-osis="John.7.33"><span class="verse-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span>on which Jesus said: <span class="woc">“I will be with you but a little longer, and then I am going to him who sent me.</span></span>
<span class="verse John_7_34" data-osis="John.7.34"><span class="verse-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">You will look for me, and you will not find me; and you will not be able to come where I will be.”</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_7_35" data-osis="John.7.35"><span class="verse-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span>“Where is this man going,” the people asked one another, “that we would not find him? Will he go to our countrymen abroad, and teach foreigners?</span>
<span class="verse John_7_36" data-osis="John.7.36"><span class="verse-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span>What does he mean by saying <span class="woc">‘You will look for me, and you will not find me; and you will not be able to come where I will be’?”</span></span>
<span class="verse John_7_37" data-osis="John.7.37"><span class="verse-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span>On the last and greatest day of the Festival, Jesus, who was standing by, exclaimed: <span class="woc">“If anyone thirsts, let him come to me, and drink.</span></span>
<span class="verse John_7_38" data-osis="John.7.38"><span class="verse-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">I tell you what I have myself seen in the presence of my Father; and you, in the same way, do what you have learned from your father.”</span></span>
<span class="verse John_7_39" data-osis="John.7.39"><span class="verse-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span>(By this he meant the Spirit, which those who had believed in him were to receive; for the Spirit had not yet come, because Jesus had not yet been exalted.)</span>
<span class="verse John_7_40" data-osis="John.7.40"><span class="verse-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">But, as it is, you are seeking to put me to death — a man who has told you the truth as he heard it from God. Abraham did not act in that way.</span></span>
<span class="verse John_7_41" data-osis="John.7.41"><span class="verse-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">You are doing what your own father does.”</span></span>
</p>
<p>“We are not bastards,” they said, “we have one Father — God himself.”
<span class="verse John_7_42" data-osis="John.7.42"><span class="verse-num v-42">42&nbsp;</span>Is not it said in scripture that it is of the race of David, and from Bethlehem, the village to which David belonged, that the Christ is to come?”</span>
<span class="verse John_7_43" data-osis="John.7.43"><span class="verse-num v-43">43&nbsp;</span>So there was a sharp division among the people because of Jesus.</span>
<span class="verse John_7_44" data-osis="John.7.44"><span class="verse-num v-44">44&nbsp;</span>Some of them wanted to arrest him, and yet no one touched him.</span>
<span class="verse John_7_45" data-osis="John.7.45"><span class="verse-num v-45">45&nbsp;</span>When the officers returned to the chief priests and Pharisees, they were asked: “Why have you not brought him?”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_7_46" data-osis="John.7.46"><span class="verse-num v-46">46&nbsp;</span>“No one ever spoke as he speaks!” they answered.</span>
<span class="verse John_7_47" data-osis="John.7.47"><span class="verse-num v-47">47&nbsp;</span>“What! Have you been led astray too?” the Pharisees replied.</span>
<span class="verse John_7_48" data-osis="John.7.48"><span class="verse-num v-48">48&nbsp;</span>“Have any of our leading men believed in him, or any of the Pharisees?</span>
<span class="verse John_7_49" data-osis="John.7.49"><span class="verse-num v-49">49&nbsp;</span>As for these people who do not know the Law — they are cursed!</span>
<span class="verse John_7_50" data-osis="John.7.50"><span class="verse-num v-50">50&nbsp;</span>But one of their number, Nicodemus, who before this had been to see Jesus, said to them:</span>
<span class="verse John_7_51" data-osis="John.7.51"><span class="verse-num v-51">51&nbsp;</span>“Does our law pass judgment on a person without first giving them a hearing, and finding out what they have been doing?”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_7_52" data-osis="John.7.52"><span class="verse-num v-52">52&nbsp;</span>“Are you also from Galilee?” they retorted. “Search, and you will find that no prophet is to arise in Galilee!”</span>
<span class="verse John_7_53" data-osis="John.7.53"><span class="verse-num v-53">53&nbsp;</span>And everyone went home</span>

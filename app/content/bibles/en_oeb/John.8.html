<h2 class="chapter-num">8</h2>
<p>
<span class="verse John_8_1" data-osis="John.8.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>except Jesus, who went to the Mount of Olives{This passage is inserted in some manuscripts from an ancient source, and found either after John 7:53 or after Luke 21.38 or elsewhere.}.</span>
<span class="verse John_8_2" data-osis="John.8.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>But he went again into the Temple Courts early in the morning, and all the people came to him; and he sat down and taught them.</span>
<span class="verse John_8_3" data-osis="John.8.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>Presently, however, the Teachers of the Law and the Pharisees brought a woman who had been caught in adultery, and placed her in the middle of the Court,</span>
<span class="verse John_8_4" data-osis="John.8.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>and said to Jesus:</span>
</p>
<p>“Teacher, this woman was found in the  act of adultery. Now Moses,in the Law, commanded us to stone such women to death; what do you say?”
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_8_6" data-osis="John.8.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>They said this to test him, in order to have a charge to bring against him. But Jesus stooped down, and wrote on the ground with his finger.</span>
<span class="verse John_8_7" data-osis="John.8.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>However, as they continued asking him, he raised himself, and said:</span>
</p>
<p>“Let the person among you who has never done wrong throw the first stone at her.”
<span class="verse John_8_8" data-osis="John.8.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span></span>
</p>
<p>And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground.
<span class="verse John_8_9" data-osis="John.8.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>When they heard that, they went out one by one, beginning with the eldest; and Jesus was left alone with the woman in the middle of the Court.</span>
<span class="verse John_8_10" data-osis="John.8.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>Raising himself, Jesus said to her:</span>
</p>
<p>“Woman, where are they? Did no one condemn you?”
<span class="verse John_8_11" data-osis="John.8.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span></span>
</p>
<p>“No one, Sir,” she answered.
</p>
<p>“Neither do I condemn you,” said Jesus “go, and do not sin again.”
<span class="verse John_8_12" data-osis="John.8.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>Jesus again addressed the people. <span class="woc">“I am the light of the world,”</span>he said. <span class="woc">“The person who follows me will not walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.”</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_8_13" data-osis="John.8.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>“You are bearing testimony to yourself!” exclaimed the Pharisees, “your testimony is not trustworthy.”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_8_14" data-osis="John.8.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">“Even if I bear testimony to myself,”</span>answered Jesus, <span class="woc">“my testimony is trustworthy; for I know where I came from, and where I am going; but you do not know where I come from, nor where I am going.</span></span>
<span class="verse John_8_15" data-osis="John.8.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">You judge by appearances; I judge no one.</span></span>
<span class="verse John_8_16" data-osis="John.8.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Yet, even if I were to judge, my judgment would be trustworthy; because I am not alone, but the Father who sent me is with me.</span></span>
<span class="verse John_8_17" data-osis="John.8.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Why, in your own law it is said that the testimony of two persons is trustworthy.</span></span>
<span class="verse John_8_18" data-osis="John.8.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">I, who bear testimony to myself, am one, and the Father who sent me also bears testimony to me.”</span></span>
<span class="verse John_8_19" data-osis="John.8.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">“Where is your father, then?”</span>they asked. <span class="woc">“You know neither me nor my Father,”</span>replied Jesus. <span class="woc">“If you had known me, you would have also known my Father.”</span></span>
<span class="verse John_8_20" data-osis="John.8.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>These statements Jesus made in the Treasury, while teaching in the Temple Courts. Yet no one arrested him, for his time had not then come.</span>
<span class="verse John_8_21" data-osis="John.8.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>Jesus again spoke to the people. <span class="woc">“I am going away,”</span>he said, <span class="woc">“and you will look for me, but you will die in your sin; you cannot come where I am going.”</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_8_22" data-osis="John.8.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>“Is he going to kill himself,” the people exclaimed, “that he says — <span class="woc">‘You cannot go where I am going’?”</span></span>
<span class="verse John_8_23" data-osis="John.8.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">“You,”</span>added Jesus, <span class="woc">“are from below, I am from above; you are of this present world, I am not;</span></span>
<span class="verse John_8_24" data-osis="John.8.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">and so I told you that you would die in your sins, for, unless you believe that I am what I am, you will die in your sins.”</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_8_25" data-osis="John.8.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span>“Who are you?” they asked. <span class="woc">“Why ask exactly what I have been telling you?”</span>said Jesus.</span>
<span class="verse John_8_26" data-osis="John.8.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">“I have still much that concerns you to speak of and to pass judgment on; yet he who sent me may be trusted, and I speak to the world only of the things which I have heard from him.”</span></span>
<span class="verse John_8_27" data-osis="John.8.27"><span class="verse-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span>They did not understand that he meant the Father.</span>
<span class="verse John_8_28" data-osis="John.8.28"><span class="verse-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span>So Jesus added: <span class="woc">“When you have lifted up the Son of Man, then you will understand that I am what I am, and that I do nothing of myself, but that I say just what the Father has taught me.</span></span>
<span class="verse John_8_29" data-osis="John.8.29"><span class="verse-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Moreover, he who sent me is with me; he has not left me alone; for I always do what pleases him.”</span></span>
<span class="verse John_8_30" data-osis="John.8.30"><span class="verse-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span>While he was speaking in this way, many came to believe in him.</span>
<span class="verse John_8_31" data-osis="John.8.31"><span class="verse-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span>So Jesus went on to say to those  who had believed him: <span class="woc">“If you remain constant to my message, you are truly my disciples;</span></span>
<span class="verse John_8_32" data-osis="John.8.32"><span class="verse-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">and you find out the truth, and the truth will set you free.”</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_8_33" data-osis="John.8.33"><span class="verse-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span>“We are descendants of Abraham,” was their answer, “and have never yet been in slavery to anyone. What do you mean by saying <span class="woc">‘you will be set free’?”</span></span>
<span class="verse John_8_34" data-osis="John.8.34"><span class="verse-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">“In truth I tell you,”</span>replied Jesus, <span class="woc">“everyone who sins is a slave to sin.</span></span>
<span class="verse John_8_35" data-osis="John.8.35"><span class="verse-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">And a slave does not remain in the home always; but a son remains always.</span></span>
<span class="verse John_8_36" data-osis="John.8.36"><span class="verse-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">If, then, the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed!</span></span>
<span class="verse John_8_37" data-osis="John.8.37"><span class="verse-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">I know that you are descendants of Abraham; yet you are seeking to put me to death, because my message finds no place in your hearts.</span></span>
<span class="verse John_8_38" data-osis="John.8.38"><span class="verse-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">I tell you what I have myself seen in the presence of my Father; and you, in the same way, do what you have learned from your father.”</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_8_39" data-osis="John.8.39"><span class="verse-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span>“Our father is Abraham,” was their answer. <span class="woc">“If you are Abraham’s children,”</span>replied Jesus, <span class="woc">“do what Abraham did.</span></span>
<span class="verse John_8_40" data-osis="John.8.40"><span class="verse-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">But, as it is, you are seeking to put me to death — a man who has told you the truth as he heard it from God. Abraham did not act in that way.</span></span>
<span class="verse John_8_41" data-osis="John.8.41"><span class="verse-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">You are doing what your own father does.”</span></span>
</p>
<p>“We are not bastards,” they said, “we have one Father — God himself.”
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_8_42" data-osis="John.8.42"><span class="verse-num v-42">42&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">“If God were your Father,”</span>Jesus replied, <span class="woc">“you would have loved me, for I came out from God, and now am here; and I have not come of myself, but he sent me as his messenger.</span></span>
<span class="verse John_8_43" data-osis="John.8.43"><span class="verse-num v-43">43&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">How is it that you do not understand what I say? It is because you cannot bear to listen to my message.</span></span>
<span class="verse John_8_44" data-osis="John.8.44"><span class="verse-num v-44">44&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">As for you, you are children of your Father the devil, and you are determined to do what your father loves to do. He was a murderer from the first, and did not stand by the truth, because there is no truth in him. Whenever he lies, he does what is natural to him; because he is a liar, and the father of lying.</span></span>
<span class="verse John_8_45" data-osis="John.8.45"><span class="verse-num v-45">45&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">But, as for me, it is because I speak the truth to you that you do not believe me.</span></span>
<span class="verse John_8_46" data-osis="John.8.46"><span class="verse-num v-46">46&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Which of you can convict me of sin? Why then don’t you believe me, if I am speaking truth?</span></span>
<span class="verse John_8_47" data-osis="John.8.47"><span class="verse-num v-47">47&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">The person who comes from God listens to God’s teaching; the reason why you do not listen is because you do not come from God.”</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_8_48" data-osis="John.8.48"><span class="verse-num v-48">48&nbsp;</span>“Are not we right, after all,” replied the people, “in saying that you are a Samaritan, and are possessed by a demon?”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_8_49" data-osis="John.8.49"><span class="verse-num v-49">49&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">“I am not possessed by a demon,”</span>Jesus answered, <span class="woc">“but I am honoring my Father; and yet you dishonor me.</span></span>
<span class="verse John_8_50" data-osis="John.8.50"><span class="verse-num v-50">50&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Not that I am seeking honor for myself; there is one who is seeking my honor, and he decides.</span></span>
<span class="verse John_8_51" data-osis="John.8.51"><span class="verse-num v-51">51&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">In truth I tell you, if anyone lays my message to heart, he will never really die.”</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_8_52" data-osis="John.8.52"><span class="verse-num v-52">52&nbsp;</span>“Now we are sure that you are possessed by a demon,” the people replied. “Abraham died, and so did the prophets; and yet you say <span class="woc">‘If anyone lays my message to heart, they will never know death.’</span></span>
<span class="verse John_8_53" data-osis="John.8.53"><span class="verse-num v-53">53&nbsp;</span>Are you greater than our ancestor Abraham, who died? And the prophets died too. Whom do you make yourself out to be?”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_8_54" data-osis="John.8.54"><span class="verse-num v-54">54&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">“If I do honor to myself,”</span>answered Jesus, <span class="woc">“such honor counts for nothing. It is my Father who does me honor — and you say that he is your God;</span></span>
<span class="verse John_8_55" data-osis="John.8.55"><span class="verse-num v-55">55&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">and yet you have not learned to know him; but I know him; and, if I were to say that I do not know him, I should be a liar like you; but I do know him, and I lay his message to heart.</span></span>
<span class="verse John_8_56" data-osis="John.8.56"><span class="verse-num v-56">56&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Your ancestor Abraham rejoiced that he would see my day; and he did see it, and was glad.”</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_8_57" data-osis="John.8.57"><span class="verse-num v-57">57&nbsp;</span>“You are not fifty years old yet,” the people exclaimed, “and have you seen Abraham?”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_8_58" data-osis="John.8.58"><span class="verse-num v-58">58&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">“In truth I tell you,”</span>replied Jesus, <span class="woc">“before Abraham existed I was.”</span></span>
<span class="verse John_8_59" data-osis="John.8.59"><span class="verse-num v-59">59&nbsp;</span>At this they took up stones to throw at him; but Jesus hid himself, and left the Temple Courts.</span>

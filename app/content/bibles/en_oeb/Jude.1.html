<h3>The Letter from Jude</h3>
<h2 class="chapter-num">1</h2>
<p>
<span class="verse Jude_1_1" data-osis="Jude.1.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>To those who, having received the Call, have been loved by God the Father and protected by Jesus Christ, From Jude, a servant of Jesus Christ, and the brother of James.</span>
<span class="verse Jude_1_2" data-osis="Jude.1.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>May mercy, peace, and love be yours in ever-increasing measure.</span>
<span class="verse Jude_1_3" data-osis="Jude.1.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>Dear friends, while I was making every effort to write to you about our common Salvation, I felt that I must write to you at once to urge you to fight in defence of the Faith that has once for all been entrusted to the keeping of Christ&rsquo;s People.</span>
<span class="verse Jude_1_4" data-osis="Jude.1.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>For there have crept in among you certain godless people, whose sentence has long since been pronounced, and who make the mercy of God an excuse for profligacy, and disown our only lord and master, Jesus Christ.</span>
<span class="verse Jude_1_5" data-osis="Jude.1.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>Now I want to remind you &mdash; but you already know it all &mdash; that, though the Lord delivered the People from Egypt, yet he afterwards destroyed those who refused to believe in him;</span>
<span class="verse Jude_1_6" data-osis="Jude.1.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>and that even those angels, who did not keep to their appointed spheres, but left their proper homes, have been kept by him for the judgment of the Great Day in everlasting chains and black darkness.</span>
<span class="verse Jude_1_7" data-osis="Jude.1.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>Like Sodom and Gomorrah and the towns near them, which gave themselves up to fornication, and fell into unnatural vice, these angels now stand out as a warning, undergoing, as they are, the punishment of aeonian fire.</span>
<span class="verse Jude_1_8" data-osis="Jude.1.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>Yet in the very same way these men, too, cherishing vain dreams, pollute our human nature, reject control, and malign the Mighty.</span>
<span class="verse Jude_1_9" data-osis="Jude.1.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>Yet even Michael, the Archangel, when, in his dispute with the Devil, he was arguing about the body of Moses, did not venture to charge him with maligning, but said merely &lsquo;The Lord rebuke you!&rsquo;</span>
<span class="verse Jude_1_10" data-osis="Jude.1.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>But these men malign whatever they do not understand; while they use such things as they know by instinct (like the animals that have no reason) for their own corruption.</span>
<span class="verse Jude_1_11" data-osis="Jude.1.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>Alas for them! They walk in the steps of Cain; led astray by Balaam&rsquo;s love of gain, they plunge into sin, and meet their ruin through rebellion like that of Korah.</span>
<span class="verse Jude_1_12" data-osis="Jude.1.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>These are the men who are blots upon your &lsquo;Love-feasts,&rsquo; when they feast together and provide without scruple for themselves alone. They are clouds without rain, driven before the winds; they are leafless trees without a vestige of fruit, dead through and through, torn up by the roots;</span>
<span class="verse Jude_1_13" data-osis="Jude.1.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>they are wild sea waves, foaming with their own shame; they are &lsquo;wandering stars,&rsquo; for which the blackest darkness has been reserved for ever.</span>
<span class="verse Jude_1_14" data-osis="Jude.1.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>To these men, as to others, Enoch, the seventh in descent from Adam, declared &mdash;  &lsquo;See! the Lord has come with his hosts of holy ones around him,</span>
<span class="verse Jude_1_15" data-osis="Jude.1.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>to execute judgment upon all men, and to convict all godless people of all their godless acts, which in their ungodliness they have committed, and of all the harsh words which they have spoken against him, godless sinners that they are!&rsquo;</span>
<span class="verse Jude_1_16" data-osis="Jude.1.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>These men are always murmuring, and complaining of their lot; they follow where their passions lead them; they have arrogant words upon their lips; and they flatter men for the sake of what they can get from them.</span>
<span class="verse Jude_1_17" data-osis="Jude.1.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>But do you, dear friends, recall what was foretold by the Apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ;</span>
<span class="verse Jude_1_18" data-osis="Jude.1.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>how they used to say to you &mdash;  &lsquo;As time draws to an end, there will be scoffers, who will be led by their godless passions.&rsquo;</span>
<span class="verse Jude_1_19" data-osis="Jude.1.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>These are the people &mdash; animal and unspiritual &mdash; who cause divisions.</span>
<span class="verse Jude_1_20" data-osis="Jude.1.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>But do you, dear friends, build up your characters on the foundation of your most holy Faith, pray under the guidance of the Holy Spirit,</span>
<span class="verse Jude_1_21" data-osis="Jude.1.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>and keep within the love of God, while waiting for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ, to bring you to Immortal Life.</span>
<span class="verse Jude_1_22" data-osis="Jude.1.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>To some show pity, because they are in doubt. &lsquo;Drag them out of the fire,&rsquo; and save them.</span>
<span class="verse Jude_1_23" data-osis="Jude.1.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>To others show pity, but with caution, hating the very clothing polluted by their touch.</span>
<span class="verse Jude_1_24" data-osis="Jude.1.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span>To him who is able to guard you from falling, and to bring you into his glorious presence, blameless and rejoicing-</span>
<span class="verse Jude_1_25" data-osis="Jude.1.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span>to the one God, our Saviour, be ascribed, through Jesus Christ, our Lord, glory, majesty, power, and dominion, as it was before time began, is now, and shall be for all time to come. Amen.</span>

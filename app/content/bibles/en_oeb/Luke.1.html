<h4>Dedication</h4>
<span class="verse Luke_1_1" data-osis="Luke.1.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>To his Excellency, Theophilus.</span>
<p>Many attempts have been already made to draw up an because of those events which have reached their conclusion among us,
<span class="verse Luke_1_2" data-osis="Luke.1.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>just as they were reported to us by those who from the beginning were eye-witnesses, and afterwards became bearers of the message.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_1_3" data-osis="Luke.1.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>And, therefore, I also, since I have investigated all these events with great care from their very beginning, have resolved to write a connected history of them for you,</span>
<span class="verse Luke_1_4" data-osis="Luke.1.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>in order that you may be able to satisfy yourself of the accuracy of the story which you have heard from the lips of others.</span>
</p>
<h4>Birth, Parentage, Infancy and Boyhood</h4>
<span class="verse Luke_1_5" data-osis="Luke.1.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>In the reign of Herod, king of Judea, there was a priest named Zechariah, who belonged to the division called after Abijah. His wife, whose name was Elizabeth, was also a descendant of Aaron.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_1_6" data-osis="Luke.1.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>They were both righteous people, who lived blameless lives, guiding their steps by all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_1_7" data-osis="Luke.1.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>But they had no child, Elizabeth being barren; and both of them were advanced in years.</span>
<p>
<span class="verse Luke_1_8" data-osis="Luke.1.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>One day, when Zechariah was officiating as priest before God, during the turn of his division,</span>
<span class="verse Luke_1_9" data-osis="Luke.1.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>it fell to him by lot, in accordance with the practice among the priests, to go into the Temple of the Lord and burn incense;</span>
<span class="verse Luke_1_10" data-osis="Luke.1.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>and, as it was the Hour of Incense, the people were all praying outside.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_1_11" data-osis="Luke.1.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>And an angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing on the right of the Altar of Incense.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_1_12" data-osis="Luke.1.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>Zechariah was startled at the sight and was awe-struck.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_1_13" data-osis="Luke.1.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>But the angel said to him: “Do not be afraid, Zechariah; your prayer has been heard, and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, whom you will call by the name John.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_1_14" data-osis="Luke.1.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>He will be to you a joy and a delight; and many will rejoice over his birth.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_1_15" data-osis="Luke.1.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>For he will be great in the sight of the Lord; he will not drink any wine or strong drink, and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit from the very hour of his birth,</span>
<span class="verse Luke_1_16" data-osis="Luke.1.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>and will reconcile many of the Israelites to the Lord their God.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_1_17" data-osis="Luke.1.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>He will go before him in the spirit and with the power of Elijah, ‘to reconcile fathers to their children’ and the disobedient to the wisdom of the righteous, and so make ready for the Lord a people prepared for him.”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Luke_1_18" data-osis="Luke.1.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>“How can I be sure of this?” Zechariah asked the angel. “For I am an old man and my wife is advanced in years.”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Luke_1_19" data-osis="Luke.1.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>“I am Gabriel,” the angel answered, “who stand in the presence of God, and I have been sent to speak to you and to bring you this good news.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_1_20" data-osis="Luke.1.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>And now you will be silent and unable to speak until the day when this takes place, because you did not believe what I said, though my words will be fulfilled in due course.”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Luke_1_21" data-osis="Luke.1.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>Meanwhile the people were watching for Zechariah, wondering at his remaining so long in the Temple.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_1_22" data-osis="Luke.1.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>When he came out, he was unable to speak to them, and they perceived that he had seen a vision there. But Zechariah kept making signs to them, and remained dumb.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_1_23" data-osis="Luke.1.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>And, as soon as his term of service was finished, he returned home.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_1_24" data-osis="Luke.1.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span>After this his wife, Elizabeth, became pregnant and lived in seclusion for five months.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_1_25" data-osis="Luke.1.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span>“The Lord has done this for me,” she said, “he has shown me kindness and taken away the public disgrace of childlessness under which I have been living.”</span>
<span class="verse Luke_1_26" data-osis="Luke.1.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span>Six months later the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a town in Galilee called Nazareth,</span>
<span class="verse Luke_1_27" data-osis="Luke.1.27"><span class="verse-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span>to a maiden there who was engaged to a man named Joseph, a descendant of David. Her name was Mary.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_1_28" data-osis="Luke.1.28"><span class="verse-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span>Gabriel came into her presence and greeted her, saying: “You have been shown great favor - the Lord is with you..”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Luke_1_29" data-osis="Luke.1.29"><span class="verse-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span>Mary was much disturbed at his words, and was wondering to herself what such a greeting could mean,</span>
<span class="verse Luke_1_30" data-osis="Luke.1.30"><span class="verse-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span>when the angel spoke again: “Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_1_31" data-osis="Luke.1.31"><span class="verse-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span>And now, you will conceive and give birth to a son, and you will give him the name Jesus.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_1_32" data-osis="Luke.1.32"><span class="verse-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span>The child will be great and will be called ‘Son of the Most High,’ and the Lord God will give him the throne of his ancestor David,</span>
<span class="verse Luke_1_33" data-osis="Luke.1.33"><span class="verse-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span>and he will reign over the descendants of Jacob for ever; And to his kingdom there will be no end.”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Luke_1_34" data-osis="Luke.1.34"><span class="verse-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span>“How can this be?” Mary asked the angel. “For I have no husband.”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Luke_1_35" data-osis="Luke.1.35"><span class="verse-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span>“The Holy Spirit will descend on you,” answered the angel, “and the Power of the Most High will overshadow you; and therefore the child will be called ‘holy,’ and ‘Son of God.’</span>
<span class="verse Luke_1_36" data-osis="Luke.1.36"><span class="verse-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span>And Elizabeth, your cousin, is herself also expecting a son in her old age; and it is now the sixth month with her, though she is called barren;</span>
<span class="verse Luke_1_37" data-osis="Luke.1.37"><span class="verse-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span>for no promise from God will fail to be fulfilled.”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Luke_1_38" data-osis="Luke.1.38"><span class="verse-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span>“I am the servant of the Lord,” exclaimed Mary; “let it be with me as you have said.” Then the angel left her.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Luke_1_39" data-osis="Luke.1.39"><span class="verse-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span>Soon after this Mary set out, and made her way quickly into the hill-country, to a town in Judah;</span>
<span class="verse Luke_1_40" data-osis="Luke.1.40"><span class="verse-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span>and there she went into Zechariah’s house and greeted Elizabeth.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_1_41" data-osis="Luke.1.41"><span class="verse-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span>When Elizabeth heard Mary’s greeting, the child moved within her, and Elizabeth herself was filled with the Holy Spirit,</span>
<span class="verse Luke_1_42" data-osis="Luke.1.42"><span class="verse-num v-42">42&nbsp;</span>and cried aloud: “Blessed are you among women, and blessed is your unborn child!</span>
<span class="verse Luke_1_43" data-osis="Luke.1.43"><span class="verse-num v-43">43&nbsp;</span>But how have I this honor, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?</span>
<span class="verse Luke_1_44" data-osis="Luke.1.44"><span class="verse-num v-44">44&nbsp;</span>For, as soon as your greeting reached my ears, the child moved within me with delight!</span>
<span class="verse Luke_1_45" data-osis="Luke.1.45"><span class="verse-num v-45">45&nbsp;</span>Happy indeed is she who believed that the promise which she received from the Lord would be fulfilled.”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Luke_1_46" data-osis="Luke.1.46"><span class="verse-num v-46">46&nbsp;</span>And Mary said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“My soul exalts the Lord,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
<span class="verse Luke_1_47" data-osis="Luke.1.47"><span class="verse-num v-47">47&nbsp;</span>my spirit delights in God my Savior;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
<span class="verse Luke_1_48" data-osis="Luke.1.48"><span class="verse-num v-48">48&nbsp;</span>for he has remembered his humble servant girl;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And from this hour all ages will count me happy!<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
<span class="verse Luke_1_49" data-osis="Luke.1.49"><span class="verse-num v-49">49&nbsp;</span>Great things has the Almighty done for me;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And holy is his name.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
<span class="verse Luke_1_50" data-osis="Luke.1.50"><span class="verse-num v-50">50&nbsp;</span>From age to age his mercy rests<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On those who honor him.<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
<span class="verse Luke_1_51" data-osis="Luke.1.51"><span class="verse-num v-51">51&nbsp;</span>Mighty are the deeds of his arm;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He scatters the proud with their own devices,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
<span class="verse Luke_1_52" data-osis="Luke.1.52"><span class="verse-num v-52">52&nbsp;</span>he casts down princes from their thrones,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the humble he uplifts,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
<span class="verse Luke_1_53" data-osis="Luke.1.53"><span class="verse-num v-53">53&nbsp;</span>the hungry he loads with gifts,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the rich he sends empty away.<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
<span class="verse Luke_1_54" data-osis="Luke.1.54"><span class="verse-num v-54">54&nbsp;</span>He has stretched out his hand to his servant Israel,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ever mindful of his mercy<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
<span class="verse Luke_1_55" data-osis="Luke.1.55"><span class="verse-num v-55">55&nbsp;</span>(As he promised to our forefathers)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Abraham and his race for ever.”<br /><br /></span>
<span class="verse Luke_1_56" data-osis="Luke.1.56"><span class="verse-num v-56">56&nbsp;</span>Mary stayed with Elizabeth about three months, and then returned to her home.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_1_57" data-osis="Luke.1.57"><span class="verse-num v-57">57&nbsp;</span>When Elizabeth’s time came, she gave birth to a son;</span>
<span class="verse Luke_1_58" data-osis="Luke.1.58"><span class="verse-num v-58">58&nbsp;</span>and her neighbors and relations, hearing of the great goodness of the Lord to her, came to share her joy.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_1_59" data-osis="Luke.1.59"><span class="verse-num v-59">59&nbsp;</span>A week later they met to circumcise the child, and were about to call him ‘Zechariah’ after his father,</span>
<span class="verse Luke_1_60" data-osis="Luke.1.60"><span class="verse-num v-60">60&nbsp;</span>when his mother spoke up: “No, he is to be called John.”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Luke_1_61" data-osis="Luke.1.61"><span class="verse-num v-61">61&nbsp;</span>“You have no relation of that name!” they exclaimed;</span>
<span class="verse Luke_1_62" data-osis="Luke.1.62"><span class="verse-num v-62">62&nbsp;</span>and they made signs to the child’s father, to find out what he wished the child to be called.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_1_63" data-osis="Luke.1.63"><span class="verse-num v-63">63&nbsp;</span>Asking for a writing-tablet, he wrote the words — ‘His name is John.’ Everyone was surprised;</span>
<span class="verse Luke_1_64" data-osis="Luke.1.64"><span class="verse-num v-64">64&nbsp;</span>and immediately Zechariah recovered his voice and the use of his tongue, and began to bless God.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_1_65" data-osis="Luke.1.65"><span class="verse-num v-65">65&nbsp;</span>All their neighbors were awe-struck at this; and throughout the hill-country of Judea the whole story was much talked about;</span>
<span class="verse Luke_1_66" data-osis="Luke.1.66"><span class="verse-num v-66">66&nbsp;</span>and all who heard it kept it in mind, asking one another —  “What can this child be destined to become?” For the Power of the Lord was with him.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Luke_1_67" data-osis="Luke.1.67"><span class="verse-num v-67">67&nbsp;</span>Then his father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit, and, speaking under inspiration, said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
<span class="verse Luke_1_68" data-osis="Luke.1.68"><span class="verse-num v-68">68&nbsp;</span>“Blessed is the Lord, the God of Israel,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who has visited his people and wrought their deliverance,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
<span class="verse Luke_1_69" data-osis="Luke.1.69"><span class="verse-num v-69">69&nbsp;</span>and has raised up for us the Strength of our salvation<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the house of his servant David —<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
<span class="verse Luke_1_70" data-osis="Luke.1.70"><span class="verse-num v-70">70&nbsp;</span>As he promised by the lips of his holy prophets of old —<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
<span class="verse Luke_1_71" data-osis="Luke.1.71"><span class="verse-num v-71">71&nbsp;</span>salvation from our enemies and from the hands of all who hate us,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
<span class="verse Luke_1_72" data-osis="Luke.1.72"><span class="verse-num v-72">72&nbsp;</span>showing mercy to our forefathers,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And mindful of his sacred covenant.<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
<span class="verse Luke_1_73" data-osis="Luke.1.73"><span class="verse-num v-73">73&nbsp;</span>This was the oath which he swore to our forefather Abraham —<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
<span class="verse Luke_1_74" data-osis="Luke.1.74"><span class="verse-num v-74">74&nbsp;</span>That we should be rescued from the hands of our enemies,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
<span class="verse Luke_1_75" data-osis="Luke.1.75"><span class="verse-num v-75">75&nbsp;</span>and should serve him without fear in holiness and righteousness,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his presence all our days.<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
<span class="verse Luke_1_76" data-osis="Luke.1.76"><span class="verse-num v-76">76&nbsp;</span>And you, child, will be called prophet of the Most High,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For you will go before the Lord to make ready his way,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
<span class="verse Luke_1_77" data-osis="Luke.1.77"><span class="verse-num v-77">77&nbsp;</span>to give his people the knowledge of salvation<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the forgiveness of their sins,<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
<span class="verse Luke_1_78" data-osis="Luke.1.78"><span class="verse-num v-78">78&nbsp;</span>through the tender mercy of our God,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whereby the Dawn will break on us from heaven,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
<span class="verse Luke_1_79" data-osis="Luke.1.79"><span class="verse-num v-79">79&nbsp;</span>to give light to those who live in darkness and the shadow of death,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And guide our feet into the way of peace.”<br /><br /></span>
<span class="verse Luke_1_80" data-osis="Luke.1.80"><span class="verse-num v-80">80&nbsp;</span>The child grew and became strong in spirit; and he lived in the Wilds until the time came for his appearance before Israel.</span>

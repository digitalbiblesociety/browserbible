<h3>The Good News According to Luke</h3>
<h2 class="chapter-num">1</h2>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.1.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>[To his Excellency, Theophilus. Many attempts have been already made to draw up an account of those events which have reached their conclusion among us,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.1.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>just as they were reported to us by those who from the beginning were eye-witnesses, and afterwards became bearers of the Message.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.1.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>And, therefore, I also, since I have investigated all these events with great care from their very beginning, have resolved to write a connected history of them for you,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.1.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>in order that you may be able to satisfy yourself of the accuracy of the story which you have heard from the lips of others.]</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.1.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>In the reign of Herod, King of Judea, there was a priest named Zechariah, who belonged to the Division called after Abijah. His wife, whose name was Elizabeth, was also a descendant of Aaron.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.1.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>They were both righteous people, who lived blameless lives, guiding their steps by all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.1.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>But they had no child, Elizabeth being barren; and both of them were advanced in years.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.1.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>One day, when Zechariah was officiating as priest before God, during the turn of his Division,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.1.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>it fell to him by lot, in accordance with the practice among the priests, to go into the Temple of the Lord and burn incense;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.1.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>and, as it was the Hour of Incense, the people were all praying outside.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.1.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>And an angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing on the right of the Altar of Incense.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.1.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>Zechariah was startled at the sight and was awe-struck.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.1.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>But the angel said to him: &ldquo; Do not be afraid, Zechariah; your prayer has been heard, and your wife Elizabeth shall bear you a son, whom you shall call by the name John.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.1.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>He shall be to you a joy and a delight; and many shall rejoice over his birth.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.1.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord; he shall not drink any wine or strong drink, and he shall be filled with the Holy Spirit from the very hour of his birth,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.1.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span>and shall reconcile many of the Israelites to the Lord their God.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.1.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span>He shall go before him in the spirit and with the power of Elijah, &lsquo;to reconcile fathers to their children&rsquo; and the disobedient to the wisdom of the righteous, and so make ready for the Lord a people prepared for him.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.1.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;How can I be sure of this?&rdquo; Zechariah asked the angel. &ldquo;For I am an old man and my wife is advanced in years.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.1.19"><span class="verse-num">19&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;I am Gabriel,&rdquo; the angel answered, &ldquo;who stand in the presence of God, and I have been sent to speak to you and to bring you this good news.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.1.20"><span class="verse-num">20&nbsp;</span>And now you shall be silent and unable to speak until the day when this takes place, because you did not believe what I said, though my words will be fulfilled in due course.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.1.21"><span class="verse-num">21&nbsp;</span>Meanwhile the people were watching for Zechariah, wondering at his remaining so long in the Temple.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.1.22"><span class="verse-num">22&nbsp;</span>When he came out, he was unable to speak to them, and they perceived that he had seen a vision there. But Zechariah kept making signs to them, and remained dumb.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.1.23"><span class="verse-num">23&nbsp;</span>And, as soon as his term of service was finished, he returned home.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.1.24"><span class="verse-num">24&nbsp;</span>After this his wife, Elizabeth, expecting to become a mother, lived in seclusion for five months.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.1.25"><span class="verse-num">25&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;This is what the Lord has done for me,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;now that he has deigned to take away the reproach under which I have been living.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.1.26"><span class="verse-num">26&nbsp;</span>Six months later the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a town in Galilee called Nazareth,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.1.27"><span class="verse-num">27&nbsp;</span>to a maiden there who was betrothed to a man named Joseph, a descendant of David. Her name was Mary.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.1.28"><span class="verse-num">28&nbsp;</span>Gabriel came into her presence and said: &ldquo;Hail, you who have been highly favoured! The Lord is with you.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.1.29"><span class="verse-num">29&nbsp;</span>Mary was much disturbed at his words, and was wondering to herself what such a greeting could mean,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.1.30"><span class="verse-num">30&nbsp;</span>when the angel spoke again: &ldquo;Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favour with God.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.1.31"><span class="verse-num">31&nbsp;</span>And now, you shall be with child and give birth to a son, and you shall give him the name Jesus.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.1.32"><span class="verse-num">32&nbsp;</span>The child shall be great and shall be called &lsquo;Son of the Most High,&rsquo; and the Lord God will give him the throne of his ancestor David,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.1.33"><span class="verse-num">33&nbsp;</span>and he shall reign over the descendants of Jacob for ever; And to his kingdom there shall be no end.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.1.34"><span class="verse-num">34&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;How can this be?&rdquo; Mary asked the angel. &ldquo;For I have no husband.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.1.35"><span class="verse-num">35&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;The Holy Spirit shall descend upon you,&rdquo; answered the angel, &ldquo;and the Power of the Most High shall overshadow you; and therefore the child will be called &lsquo;holy,&rsquo; and &lsquo;Son of God.&rsquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.1.36"><span class="verse-num">36&nbsp;</span>And Elizabeth, your cousin, is herself also expecting a son in her old age; and it is now the sixth month with her, though she is called barren;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.1.37"><span class="verse-num">37&nbsp;</span>for no promise from God shall fail to be fulfilled.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.1.38"><span class="verse-num">38&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;I am the servant of the Lord,&rdquo; exclaimed Mary; &ldquo;let it be with me as you have said.&rdquo; Then the angel left her.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.1.39"><span class="verse-num">39&nbsp;</span>Soon after this Mary set out, and made her way quickly into the hill-country, to a town in Judah;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.1.40"><span class="verse-num">40&nbsp;</span>and there she went into Zechariah&rsquo;s house and greeted Elizabeth.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.1.41"><span class="verse-num">41&nbsp;</span>When Elizabeth heard Mary&rsquo;s greeting, the child moved within her, and Elizabeth herself was filled with the Holy Spirit,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.1.42"><span class="verse-num">42&nbsp;</span>and cried aloud: &ldquo;Blessed are you among women, and blessed is your unborn child!</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.1.43"><span class="verse-num">43&nbsp;</span>But how have I this honour, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.1.44"><span class="verse-num">44&nbsp;</span>For, as soon as your greeting reached my ears, the child moved within me with delight!</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.1.45"><span class="verse-num">45&nbsp;</span>Happy indeed is she who believed that the promise which she received from the Lord would be fulfilled.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.1.46"><span class="verse-num">46&nbsp;</span>And Mary said: &ldquo;My soul exalts the Lord,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.1.47"><span class="verse-num">47&nbsp;</span>my spirit delights in God my Saviour;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.1.48"><span class="verse-num">48&nbsp;</span>for he has remembered his servant in her lowliness; And from this hour all ages will count me happy!</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.1.49"><span class="verse-num">49&nbsp;</span>Great things has the Almighty done for me; And holy is his name.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.1.50"><span class="verse-num">50&nbsp;</span>From age to age his mercy rests On those who reverence him.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.1.51"><span class="verse-num">51&nbsp;</span>Mighty are the deeds of his arm; He scatters the proud with their own devices,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.1.52"><span class="verse-num">52&nbsp;</span>he casts down princes from their thrones, and the lowly he uplifts,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.1.53"><span class="verse-num">53&nbsp;</span>the hungry he loads with gifts, and the rich he sends empty away.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.1.54"><span class="verse-num">54&nbsp;</span>He has stretched out his hand to his servant Israel, Ever mindful of his mercy</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.1.55"><span class="verse-num">55&nbsp;</span>(As he promised to our forefathers) For Abraham and his race for ever.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.1.56"><span class="verse-num">56&nbsp;</span>Mary stayed with Elizabeth about three months, and then returned to her home.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.1.57"><span class="verse-num">57&nbsp;</span>When Elizabeth&rsquo;s time came, she gave birth to a son;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.1.58"><span class="verse-num">58&nbsp;</span>and her neighbours and relations, hearing of the great goodness of the Lord to her, came to share her joy.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.1.59"><span class="verse-num">59&nbsp;</span>A week later they met to circumcise the child, and were about to call him &lsquo;Zechariah&rsquo; after his father,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.1.60"><span class="verse-num">60&nbsp;</span>when his mother interposed: &ldquo;No, he is to be called John.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.1.61"><span class="verse-num">61&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;You have no relation of that name!&rdquo; they exclaimed;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.1.62"><span class="verse-num">62&nbsp;</span>and they made signs to the child&rsquo;s father, to find out what he wished the child to be called.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.1.63"><span class="verse-num">63&nbsp;</span>Asking for a writing-tablet, he wrote the words &mdash; &lsquo;His name is John.&rsquo; Every one was surprised;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.1.64"><span class="verse-num">64&nbsp;</span>and immediately Zechariah recovered his voice and the use of his tongue, and began to bless God.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.1.65"><span class="verse-num">65&nbsp;</span>All their neighbours were awe-struck at this; and throughout the hill-country of Judea the whole story was much talked about;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.1.66"><span class="verse-num">66&nbsp;</span>and all who heard it kept it in mind, asking one another &mdash;  &ldquo;What can this child be destined to become?&rdquo; For the Power of the Lord was with him.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.1.67"><span class="verse-num">67&nbsp;</span>Then his father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit, and, speaking under inspiration, said:</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.1.68"><span class="verse-num">68&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Blessed is the Lord, the God of Israel, Who has visited his people and wrought their deliverance,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.1.69"><span class="verse-num">69&nbsp;</span>and has raised up for us the Strength of our Salvation In the House of his servant David &mdash;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.1.70"><span class="verse-num">70&nbsp;</span>As he promised by the lips of his Holy Prophets of old &mdash;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.1.71"><span class="verse-num">71&nbsp;</span>Salvation from our enemies and from the hands of all that hate us,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.1.72"><span class="verse-num">72&nbsp;</span>showing mercy to our forefathers, And mindful of his sacred Covenant.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.1.73"><span class="verse-num">73&nbsp;</span>This was the oath which he swore to our forefather Abraham &mdash;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.1.74"><span class="verse-num">74&nbsp;</span>That we should be rescued from the hands of our enemies,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.1.75"><span class="verse-num">75&nbsp;</span>and should serve him without fear in holiness and righteousness, In his presence all our days.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.1.76"><span class="verse-num">76&nbsp;</span>And thou, Child, shalt be called Prophet of the Most High, For thou shalt go before the Lord to make ready his way,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.1.77"><span class="verse-num">77&nbsp;</span>to give his people the knowledge of salvation In the forgiveness of their sins,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.1.78"><span class="verse-num">78&nbsp;</span>through the tender mercy of our God, Whereby the Dawn will break on us from Heaven,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.1.79"><span class="verse-num">79&nbsp;</span>to give light to those who dwell in darkness and the shadow of death, And guide our feet into the way of peace.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.1.80"><span class="verse-num">80&nbsp;</span>The child grew and became strong in spirit; and he lived in the Wilds till the time came for his appearance before Israel.</span>

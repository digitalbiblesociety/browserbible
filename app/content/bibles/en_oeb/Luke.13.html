<p>
<span class="verse Luke_13_1" data-osis="Luke.13.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>Just at that time some people had come to tell Jesus about the Galileans, whose blood Pilate had mingled with the blood of their sacrifices.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_13_2" data-osis="Luke.13.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">“Do you suppose,”</span>replied Jesus, <span class="woc">“that, because these Galileans have suffered in this way, they were worse sinners than any other Galileans?</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_13_3" data-osis="Luke.13.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">No, I tell you; but, unless you repent, you will all perish as they did.</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_13_4" data-osis="Luke.13.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Or those eighteen men at Siloam on whom the tower fell, killing them all, do you suppose that they were worse offenders than any other inhabitants of Jerusalem?</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_13_5" data-osis="Luke.13.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">No, I tell you; but, unless you repent, you will all perish in the same manner.”</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Luke_13_6" data-osis="Luke.13.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>And Jesus told them this parable — <span class="woc">“A man, who had a fig tree growing in his vineyard, came to look for fruit on it, but could not find any.</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_13_7" data-osis="Luke.13.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">So he said to his gardener ‘Three years now I have come to look for fruit on this fig tree, without finding any! Cut it down. Why should it rob the soil?’</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_13_8" data-osis="Luke.13.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">‘Leave it this one year more, Sir,’ the man answered, ‘until I have dug around it and manured it.</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_13_9" data-osis="Luke.13.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Then, if it bears in future, well and good; but if not, you can have it cut down.’”</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_13_10" data-osis="Luke.13.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>Jesus was teaching on a Sabbath in one of the Synagogues,</span>
<span class="verse Luke_13_11" data-osis="Luke.13.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>and he saw before him a woman who for eighteen years had suffered from weakness owing to her having an evil spirit in her. She was bent double, and was wholly unable to raise herself.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_13_12" data-osis="Luke.13.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>When Jesus saw her, he called her to him, and said: <span class="woc">“Woman, you are released from your weakness.”</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_13_13" data-osis="Luke.13.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>He placed his hands on her, and she was instantly made straight, and began to praise God.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_13_14" data-osis="Luke.13.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>But the synagogue leader, indignant that Jesus had worked the cure on the Sabbath, intervened and said to the people: “There are six days on which work ought to be done; come to be cured on one of those, and not on the Sabbath.”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Luke_13_15" data-osis="Luke.13.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">“You hypocrites!”</span>the Master answered him. <span class="woc">“Does not everyone of you let your ox or your ass loose from its manger, and take it out to drink, on the Sabbath?</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_13_16" data-osis="Luke.13.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">But this woman, a daughter of Abraham, who has been kept in bondage by Satan for now eighteen years, ought not she to have been released from her bondage on the Sabbath?”</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_13_17" data-osis="Luke.13.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>As he said this, his opponents all felt ashamed; but all the people rejoiced to see all the wonderful things that he was doing.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Luke_13_18" data-osis="Luke.13.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>So Jesus said: <span class="woc">“What is the kingdom of God like? And to what can I liken it?</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_13_19" data-osis="Luke.13.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">It is like a mustard seed which a man took and put in his garden. The seed grew and became a tree, and ‘the wild birds roosted in its branches.’”</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_13_20" data-osis="Luke.13.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>And again Jesus said: <span class="woc">“To what can I liken the kingdom of God?</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_13_21" data-osis="Luke.13.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">It is like some yeast which a woman took and covered in three pecks of flour, until the whole had risen.”</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Luke_13_22" data-osis="Luke.13.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>Jesus went through towns and villages, teaching as he went, and making his way towards Jerusalem.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_13_23" data-osis="Luke.13.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>“Master,” some one asked, “are there but few in the path of salvation?” And Jesus answered:</span>
<span class="verse Luke_13_24" data-osis="Luke.13.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">“Strive to go in by the small door. Many, I tell you, will seek to go in, but they will not be able,</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_13_25" data-osis="Luke.13.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">when once the master of the house has got up and shut the door, while you begin to say, as you stand outside and knock, ‘Sir, open the door for us.’ His answer will be — ‘I do not know where you come from.’</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_13_26" data-osis="Luke.13.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Then you will begin to say ‘We have eaten and drunk in your presence, and you have taught in our streets,’ and his reply will be — </span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_13_27" data-osis="Luke.13.27"><span class="verse-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">‘I do not know where you come from. Leave my presence, all you who are living in wickedness.’</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_13_28" data-osis="Luke.13.28"><span class="verse-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">There, there will be weeping and grinding of teeth, when you see Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets, in the kingdom of God, while you yourselves are being driven outside.</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_13_29" data-osis="Luke.13.29"><span class="verse-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">People will come from East and West, and from North and South, and take their places at the banquet in the kingdom of God.</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_13_30" data-osis="Luke.13.30"><span class="verse-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">there are some who are last now who will then be first, and some who are first now who will then be last!”</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Luke_13_31" data-osis="Luke.13.31"><span class="verse-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span>Just then some Pharisees came up to Jesus and said: “Go away and leave this place, for Herod wants to kill you.”</span>
<span class="verse Luke_13_32" data-osis="Luke.13.32"><span class="verse-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span>But Jesus answered: <span class="woc">“Go and say to that fox ‘Look you, I am driving out demons and will be completing cures today and tomorrow, and on the third day I will have done.’</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_13_33" data-osis="Luke.13.33"><span class="verse-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">But today and tomorrow and the day after I must go on my way, because it cannot be that a prophet should meet his end outside Jerusalem.</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_13_34" data-osis="Luke.13.34"><span class="verse-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Jerusalem! Jerusalem! You who slays the prophets and stones the messengers sent to you — Oh, how often have I wished to gather your children around me, as a hen takes her brood under her wings, and you would not come!</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_13_35" data-osis="Luke.13.35"><span class="verse-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Verily your house is left to you desolate! And never, I tell you, will you see me, until you say —<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord.’”</span><br /><br /></span>

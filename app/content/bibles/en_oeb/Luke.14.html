<h2 class="chapter-num">14</h2>
<p>
<span class="verse Luke_14_1" data-osis="Luke.14.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>On one occasion, as Jesus was going, on a Sabbath into the house of one of the leading Pharisees to dine, they were watching him closely.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_14_2" data-osis="Luke.14.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>There he saw before him a man who was suffering from dropsy.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_14_3" data-osis="Luke.14.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">“Is it allowable,”</span>said Jesus, addressing the students of the law and the Pharisees, <span class="woc">“to work a cure on the Sabbath, or is it not?”</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_14_4" data-osis="Luke.14.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>They remained silent. Jesus took hold of the man and cured him, and sent him away.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_14_5" data-osis="Luke.14.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>And he said to them: <span class="woc">“Which of you, finding that your son or your ox has fallen into a well, will not immediately pull them out on the Sabbath day?”</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_14_6" data-osis="Luke.14.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>And they could not make any answer to that.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Luke_14_7" data-osis="Luke.14.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>Observing that the guests were choosing the best places for themselves, Jesus told them this parable —</span>
<span class="verse Luke_14_8" data-osis="Luke.14.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">“When you are invited by anyone to a wedding banquet, do not seat yourself in the best place. Someone of higher rank might have been invited by your host;</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_14_9" data-osis="Luke.14.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">and the host who invited you both will come and say to you ‘Make room for this person,’ and then you will begin in confusion to take the lowest place.</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_14_10" data-osis="Luke.14.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">No, when you are invited, go and take the lowest place, so that, when the host who has invited you comes, he may say to you ‘Friend, come higher up’; and then you will be honored in the eyes of all your fellow guests.</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_14_11" data-osis="Luke.14.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">For everyone who exalts themselves will be humbled, and everyone who humbles themselves will be exalted.”</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Luke_14_12" data-osis="Luke.14.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>Then Jesus went on to say to the man who had invited him: <span class="woc">“When you give a breakfast or a dinner, do not ask your friends, or your brothers or sisters, or your relations, or rich neighbors, because they might invite you in return, and so you should be repaid.</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_14_13" data-osis="Luke.14.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">No, when you entertain, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, the blind;</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_14_14" data-osis="Luke.14.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">and then you will be happy indeed, since they cannot reward you; for you will be rewarded at the resurrection of the good.”</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Luke_14_15" data-osis="Luke.14.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>One of the guests heard what he said and exclaimed: “Happy will be the person who will eat bread in the kingdom of God!”</span>
<span class="verse Luke_14_16" data-osis="Luke.14.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>But Jesus said to him: <span class="woc">“A man was once giving a great dinner. He invited many people,</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_14_17" data-osis="Luke.14.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">and sent his servant, when it was time for the dinner, to say to those who had been invited ‘Come, for everything is now ready.’</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_14_18" data-osis="Luke.14.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">They all with one accord began to ask to be excused. The first said to the servant ‘I have bought a field and am obliged to go and look at it. I must ask you to consider me excused.’</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_14_19" data-osis="Luke.14.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">The next said ‘I have bought five pairs of bullocks, and I am on my way to try them. I must ask you to consider me excused’;</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_14_20" data-osis="Luke.14.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">while the next said ‘I am just married, and for that reason I am unable to come.’</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_14_21" data-osis="Luke.14.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">On his return the servant told his master all these answers. Then in anger the owner of the house said to his servant ‘Go out at once into the streets and alleys of the town, and bring in here the poor, and the crippled, and the blind, and the lame.’</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_14_22" data-osis="Luke.14.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Presently the servant said ‘Sir, your order has been carried out, and still there is room.’</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_14_23" data-osis="Luke.14.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">‘Go out,’ the master said, ‘into the roads and hedgerows, and make people come in, so that my house may be filled;</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_14_24" data-osis="Luke.14.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">for I tell you all that not one of those people who were invited will taste my dinner.’”</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Luke_14_25" data-osis="Luke.14.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span>One day, when great crowds of people were walking with Jesus, he turned and said to them:</span>
<span class="verse Luke_14_26" data-osis="Luke.14.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">“If any one comes to me and does not hate their father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brothers, and sisters, yes and even their life, he can be no disciple of mine.</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_14_27" data-osis="Luke.14.27"><span class="verse-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Whoever does not carry their own cross, and walk in my steps, can be no disciple of mine.</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_14_28" data-osis="Luke.14.28"><span class="verse-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Why, which of you, when you want to build a tower, does not first sit down and reckon the cost, to see if you have enough to complete it? — </span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_14_29" data-osis="Luke.14.29"><span class="verse-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Otherwise, if you have laid the foundation and are not able to finish it, everyone who sees it will laugh at you,</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_14_30" data-osis="Luke.14.30"><span class="verse-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">and say ‘Here is a person who began to build and was not able to finish!’</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_14_31" data-osis="Luke.14.31"><span class="verse-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Or what king, when he is setting out to fight another king, does not first sit down and consider if with ten thousand men he is able to meet one who is coming against him with twenty thousand?</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_14_32" data-osis="Luke.14.32"><span class="verse-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">And if he cannot, then, while the other is still at a distance, he sends envoys and asks for terms of peace.</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_14_33" data-osis="Luke.14.33"><span class="verse-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">And so with everyone of you who does not bid farewell to all you have — you cannot be a disciple of mine.</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_14_34" data-osis="Luke.14.34"><span class="verse-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Yes, salt is good; but, if the salt itself should lose its strength, what will be used to season it?</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_14_35" data-osis="Luke.14.35"><span class="verse-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">It is not fit either for the land or for the manure heap. People throw it away. Let those who have ears to hear with hear!”</span></span>

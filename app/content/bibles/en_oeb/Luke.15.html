<span class="verse Luke_15_1" data-osis="Luke.15.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>The tax-gatherers and the outcasts were all drawing near to Jesus to listen to him;</span>
<span class="verse Luke_15_2" data-osis="Luke.15.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>but the Pharisees and the Teachers of the Law found fault. &ldquo;This man always welcomes outcasts, and takes meals with them!&rdquo; they complained.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_15_3" data-osis="Luke.15.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>So Jesus told them this parable &mdash;</span>
<span class="verse Luke_15_4" data-osis="Luke.15.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;What man among you who has a hundred sheep, and has lost one of them, does not leave the ninety-nine out in the open country, and go after the lost sheep till he finds it?</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_15_5" data-osis="Luke.15.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> And, when he has found it, he puts in on his shoulders rejoicing;</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_15_6" data-osis="Luke.15.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> and, on reaching home, he calls his friends and his neighbours together, and says &lsquo;Come and rejoice with me, for I have found my sheep which was lost.&rsquo;</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_15_7" data-osis="Luke.15.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> So, I tell you, there will be more rejoicing in Heaven over one outcast that repents, than over ninety-nine religious men, who have no need to repent.</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_15_8" data-osis="Luke.15.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Or again, what woman who has ten silver coins, if she loses one of them, does not light a lamp, and sweep the house, and search carefully until she finds it?</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_15_9" data-osis="Luke.15.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> And, when she has found it, she calls her friends and neighbours together, and says &lsquo;Come and rejoice with me, for I have found the coin which I lost.&rsquo;</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_15_10" data-osis="Luke.15.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> So, I tell you, there is rejoicing in the presence of God&rsquo;s angels over one outcast that repents.&rdquo;</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_15_11" data-osis="Luke.15.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>Then Jesus continued: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;A man had two sons;</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_15_12" data-osis="Luke.15.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> and the younger of them said to his father &lsquo;Father, give me my share of the inheritance.&rsquo; So the father divided the property between them.</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_15_13" data-osis="Luke.15.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> A few days later the younger son got together all that he had, and went away into a distant land; and there he squandered his inheritance by leading a dissolute life.</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_15_14" data-osis="Luke.15.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> After he has spent all that he had, there was a severe famine through all that country, and he began to be in actual want.</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_15_15" data-osis="Luke.15.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> So he went and engaged himself to one of the people of that country, who sent him into his fields to tend pigs.</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_15_16" data-osis="Luke.15.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> He even longed to satisfy his hunger with the bean-pods on which the pigs were feeding; and no one gave him anything.</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_15_17" data-osis="Luke.15.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> But, when he came to himself, he said &lsquo;How many of my father&rsquo;s hired servants have more bread than they can eat, while here am I starving to death!</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_15_18" data-osis="Luke.15.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> I will get up and go to my father, and say to him &ldquo;Father, I sinned against Heaven and against you;</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_15_19" data-osis="Luke.15.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> I am no longer fit to be called your son; make me one of your hired servants.&rdquo;&rsquo;</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_15_20" data-osis="Luke.15.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> And he got up and went to his father. But, while he was still a long way off, his father saw him and was deeply moved; he ran and threw his arms round his neck and kissed him.</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_15_21" data-osis="Luke.15.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &lsquo;Father,&rsquo; the son said, &lsquo;I sinned against Heaven and against you; I am no longer fit to be called your son; make me one of your hired servants.&rsquo;</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_15_22" data-osis="Luke.15.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> But the father turned to his servants and said &lsquo;Be quick and fetch a robe &mdash; the very best &mdash; and put it on him; give him a ring for his finger and sandals for his feet;</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_15_23" data-osis="Luke.15.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> and bring the fattened calf and kill it, and let us eat and make merry;</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_15_24" data-osis="Luke.15.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> for here is my son who was dead, and is alive again, was lost, and is found.&rsquo; So they began making merry.</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_15_25" data-osis="Luke.15.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Meanwhile the elder son was out in the fields; but, on coming home, when he got near the house, he heard music and dancing,</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_15_26" data-osis="Luke.15.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> and he called one of the servants and asked what it all meant.</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_15_27" data-osis="Luke.15.27"><span class="verse-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &lsquo;Your brother has come back,&rsquo; the servant told him, &lsquo;and your father has killed the fattened calf, because he has him back safe and sound.&rsquo;</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_15_28" data-osis="Luke.15.28"><span class="verse-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> This made him angry, and he would not go in. But his father came out and begged him to do so.</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_15_29" data-osis="Luke.15.29"><span class="verse-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &lsquo;No,&rsquo; he said to his father, &lsquo;look at all the years I have been serving you, without ever once disobeying you, and yet you have never given me even a kid, so that I might have a merry-making with my friends.</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_15_30" data-osis="Luke.15.30"><span class="verse-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> But, no sooner has this son of yours come, who has eaten up your property in the company of prostitutes, than you have killed the fattened calf for him.&rsquo;</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_15_31" data-osis="Luke.15.31"><span class="verse-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &lsquo;Child,&rsquo; the father answered, &lsquo;you are always with me, and everything that I have is yours.</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_15_32" data-osis="Luke.15.32"><span class="verse-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> We could but make merry and rejoice, for here is your brother who was dead, and is alive; who was lost, and is found.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></span>

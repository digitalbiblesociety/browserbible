<span class="verse Luke_17_2" data-osis="Luke.17.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">It would be good for them if they had been flung into the sea with a millstone around their neck, rather than that they should prove a trap even one of these little ones.</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_17_3" data-osis="Luke.17.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Be on your guard! If your brother or sister does wrong, rebuke them; but if they repent, forgive them.</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_17_4" data-osis="Luke.17.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Even if they wrong you seven times a day, but turns to you every time and says ‘I am sorry,’ you must forgive them.”</span></span>

<span class="verse Luke_17_5" data-osis="Luke.17.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>“Give us more faith,” said the apostles to the Master;</span>
<span class="verse Luke_17_6" data-osis="Luke.17.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>but the Master said: <span class="woc">“If your faith were only like a mustard seed, you could say to this mulberry tree ‘Be uprooted and planted in the sea,’ and it would obey you.</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_17_7" data-osis="Luke.17.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Which of you, if he had a servant ploughing, or tending the sheep, would say to him, when he came in from the fields, ‘Come at once and take your place at the table,’</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_17_8" data-osis="Luke.17.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Instead of saying ‘Prepare my dinner, and then make yourself ready and serve me while I am eating and drinking, and after that you will eat and drink yourself’?</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_17_9" data-osis="Luke.17.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Does he feel grateful to his servant for doing what he is told?</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_17_10" data-osis="Luke.17.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">And so with you — when you have done all that you have been told, still say ‘We are but useless servants; we have done no more than we ought to have done.’”</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_17_11" data-osis="Luke.17.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>On the way to Jerusalem Jesus passed between Samaria and Galilee.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_17_12" data-osis="Luke.17.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>As he was entering a village, ten lepers met him.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_17_13" data-osis="Luke.17.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>Standing still, some distance off, they called out loudly: “Jesus! Sir! Pity us!”</span>
<span class="verse Luke_17_14" data-osis="Luke.17.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>When Jesus saw them, he said: <span class="woc">“Go and show yourselves to the priest.”</span>And, as they were on their way, they were made clean.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_17_15" data-osis="Luke.17.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>One of them, finding he was cured, came back, praising God loudly,</span>
<span class="verse Luke_17_16" data-osis="Luke.17.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>and threw himself on his face at Jesus’ feet, thanking him for what he had done; and this man was a Samaritan.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_17_17" data-osis="Luke.17.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">“Were not all the ten made clean?</span>exclaimed Jesus. <span class="woc">But the nine — where are they?</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_17_18" data-osis="Luke.17.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Were there none to come back and praise God except this foreigner?</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_17_19" data-osis="Luke.17.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Get up,”</span>he said to him, <span class="woc">“and go on your way. Your faith has delivered you.”</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_17_20" data-osis="Luke.17.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>Being once asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God was to come, Jesus answered: <span class="woc">“The kingdom of God does not come in a way that can be seen,</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_17_21" data-osis="Luke.17.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">nor will people say ‘Look, here it is!’ or ‘There it is!’; for the kingdom of God is within you!</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_17_22" data-osis="Luke.17.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">The day will come,”</span>he said to his disciples, <span class="woc">“when you will long to see but one of the days of the Son of Man, and will not see it.</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_17_23" data-osis="Luke.17.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">People will say to you ‘There he is! Or ‘Here he is!’ Do not go and follow them.</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_17_24" data-osis="Luke.17.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">For, just as lightning will lighten and flare from one side of the heavens to the other, so will it be with the Son of Man.</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_17_25" data-osis="Luke.17.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">But first he must undergo much suffering, and he must be rejected by the present generation.</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_17_26" data-osis="Luke.17.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">As it was in the days of Noah, so will it be again in the days of the Son of Man.</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_17_27" data-osis="Luke.17.27"><span class="verse-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">They were eating and drinking and marrying and being married, up to the very day on which Noah entered the ark, and then the flood came and destroyed them all.</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_17_28" data-osis="Luke.17.28"><span class="verse-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">So, too, in the days of Lot. People were eating, drinking, buying, selling, planting, building;</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_17_29" data-osis="Luke.17.29"><span class="verse-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">but, on the very day on which Lot came out of Sodom, it rained fire and sulphur from the skies and destroyed them all.</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_17_30" data-osis="Luke.17.30"><span class="verse-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">It will be the same on the day on which the Son of Man reveals himself.</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_17_31" data-osis="Luke.17.31"><span class="verse-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">On that day, if a person is on their house-top and their goods in the house, they must not go down to get them; nor again must one who is on the farm turn back.</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_17_32" data-osis="Luke.17.32"><span class="verse-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Remember Lot’s wife.</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_17_33" data-osis="Luke.17.33"><span class="verse-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Whoever is eager to get the most out of their life will lose it; but whoever will lose it will preserve it.</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_17_34" data-osis="Luke.17.34"><span class="verse-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">On that night, I tell you, of two people on the same bed, one will be taken and the other left;</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_17_35" data-osis="Luke.17.35"><span class="verse-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">of two women grinding grain together, one will be taken and the other left.”</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Luke_17_37" data-osis="Luke.17.37"><span class="verse-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span>“Where will it be, Master?” asked the disciples. <span class="woc">“Where there is a body,”</span>said Jesus, <span class="woc">“‘there will the vultures flock.’”</span></span>

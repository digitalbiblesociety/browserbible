<h2 class="chapter-num">18</h2>
<p>
<span class="verse Luke_18_1" data-osis="Luke.18.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>Jesus told his disciples a parable to show them that they should always pray and never despair.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_18_2" data-osis="Luke.18.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">“There was,”</span>he said, <span class="woc">“in a certain town a judge, who had no fear of God nor regard for people.</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_18_3" data-osis="Luke.18.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">In the same town there was a widow who went to him again and again, and said ‘Grant me justice against my opponent.’</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_18_4" data-osis="Luke.18.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">For a time the judge refused, but afterwards he said to himself ‘Although I am without fear of God or regard for people,</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_18_5" data-osis="Luke.18.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">yet, as this widow is so troublesome, I will grant her justice, to stop her from plaguing me with her endless visits.’”</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_18_6" data-osis="Luke.18.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>Then the Master added: <span class="woc">“Listen to what this iniquitous judge says!</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_18_7" data-osis="Luke.18.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">And God — will not he see that his own people, who cry to him night and day, have justice done them — though he holds his hand?</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_18_8" data-osis="Luke.18.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">He will, I tell you, give them justice soon enough! Yet, when the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on earth?”</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_18_9" data-osis="Luke.18.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>Another time, speaking to people who were satisfied that they were religious, and who regarded everyone else with scorn, Jesus told this parable —</span>
<span class="verse Luke_18_10" data-osis="Luke.18.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">“Two men went up into the Temple Courts to pray. One was a Pharisee and the other a tax-gatherer.</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_18_11" data-osis="Luke.18.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">The Pharisee stood forward and began praying to himself in this way — ‘God, I thank you that I am not like other men —  thieves, rogues, adulterers — or even like this tax-gatherer.</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_18_12" data-osis="Luke.18.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">I fast twice a week, and give a tenth of everything I get to God.’</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_18_13" data-osis="Luke.18.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Meanwhile the tax-gatherer stood at a distance, not venturing even ‘to raise his eyes to heaven’; but he kept striking his breast and saying ‘God, have mercy on me, a sinner.’</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_18_14" data-osis="Luke.18.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">This man, I tell you, went home pardoned, rather than the other; for everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, while everyone who humbles himself will be exalted.”</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_18_15" data-osis="Luke.18.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>Some of the people were bringing even their babies to Jesus, for him to touch them; but, when the disciples saw it, they began to find fault with those who had brought them.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_18_16" data-osis="Luke.18.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>Jesus, however, called the little children to him. <span class="woc">“Let the little children come to me,”</span>he said, <span class="woc">“and do not hinder them; for it is to the childlike that the kingdom of God belongs.</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_18_17" data-osis="Luke.18.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">I tell you, unless a man receives the kingdom of God like a child, he will not enter it at all.”</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_18_18" data-osis="Luke.18.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>And one of the Presidents asked Jesus this question — “Good teacher, what must I do if I am to gain eternal life?”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Luke_18_19" data-osis="Luke.18.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">“Why do you call me good?”</span>answered Jesus. <span class="woc">“No one is good but God.</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_18_20" data-osis="Luke.18.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">You know the commandments — ‘Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not say what is false about others, Honor your father and your mother.’”</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Luke_18_21" data-osis="Luke.18.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>“I have observed all these,” he replied, “from childhood.”</span>
<span class="verse Luke_18_22" data-osis="Luke.18.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>Hearing this, Jesus said to him: <span class="woc">“There is one thing still lacking in you; sell everything that you have, and distribute to the poor, and you will have wealth in heaven; then come and follow me.”</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_18_23" data-osis="Luke.18.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>But the man became greatly distressed on hearing this, for he was extremely rich.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_18_24" data-osis="Luke.18.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span>Seeing this, Jesus said to his disciples: <span class="woc">“How hard it is for the wealthy to enter the kingdom of God!</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_18_25" data-osis="Luke.18.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">It is easier, indeed, for a camel to get through a needle’s eye than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God!”</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Luke_18_26" data-osis="Luke.18.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span>“Then who can be saved?” asked those who heard this.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_18_27" data-osis="Luke.18.27"><span class="verse-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span>But Jesus said: <span class="woc">“What is impossible with people is possible with God.”</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Luke_18_28" data-osis="Luke.18.28"><span class="verse-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span>“But we,” said Peter, “we left what belonged to us and followed you.”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Luke_18_29" data-osis="Luke.18.29"><span class="verse-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">“I tell you,”</span>he answered, <span class="woc">“that there is no one who has left house, or wife, or brothers, or parents, or children, for the sake of the kingdom of God,</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_18_30" data-osis="Luke.18.30"><span class="verse-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">who will not receive many times as much in the present, and in the age that is coming eternal life.”</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_18_31" data-osis="Luke.18.31"><span class="verse-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span>Gathering the Twelve around him, Jesus said to them: <span class="woc">“Listen! We are going up to Jerusalem; and there everything that is written in the prophets will be done to the Son of Man.</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_18_32" data-osis="Luke.18.32"><span class="verse-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">For he will be given up to the Gentiles, mocked, insulted and spat on;</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_18_33" data-osis="Luke.18.33"><span class="verse-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">they will scourge him, and then put him to death; and on the third day he will rise again.”</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_18_34" data-osis="Luke.18.34"><span class="verse-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span>The apostles did not comprehend any of this; his meaning was unintelligible to them, and they did not understand what he was saying.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_18_35" data-osis="Luke.18.35"><span class="verse-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span>As Jesus was getting near Jericho, a blind man was sitting by the roadside, begging.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_18_36" data-osis="Luke.18.36"><span class="verse-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span>Hearing a crowd going by, the man asked what was the matter;</span>
<span class="verse Luke_18_37" data-osis="Luke.18.37"><span class="verse-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span>and, when people told him that Jesus of Nazareth was passing,</span>
<span class="verse Luke_18_38" data-osis="Luke.18.38"><span class="verse-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span>he shouted out: “Jesus, Son of David, take pity on me!”</span>
<span class="verse Luke_18_39" data-osis="Luke.18.39"><span class="verse-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span>Those who were in front kept telling him to be quiet, but he continued to call out the louder: “Son of David, take pity on me!”</span>
<span class="verse Luke_18_40" data-osis="Luke.18.40"><span class="verse-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span>Then Jesus stopped and ordered the man to be brought to him. And, when he had come close up to him, Jesus asked him:</span>
<span class="verse Luke_18_41" data-osis="Luke.18.41"><span class="verse-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">“What do you want me to do for you?”</span></span>
</p>
<p>“Master,” he said, “I want to recover my sight.”
<span class="verse Luke_18_42" data-osis="Luke.18.42"><span class="verse-num v-42">42&nbsp;</span>And Jesus said: <span class="woc">“Recover your sight, your faith has delivered you.”</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_18_43" data-osis="Luke.18.43"><span class="verse-num v-43">43&nbsp;</span>Instantly he recovered his sight, and began to follow Jesus, praising God. And all the people, on seeing it, gave glory to God.</span>

<h2 class="chapter-num">2</h2>
<p>
<span class="verse Luke_2_1" data-osis="Luke.2.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>About that time an edict was issued by the Emperor Augustus that a census should be taken of the whole Empire.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_2_2" data-osis="Luke.2.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>(This was the first census taken while Quirinius was Governor of Syria).</span>
<span class="verse Luke_2_3" data-osis="Luke.2.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>And everyone went to his own town to be registered.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_2_4" data-osis="Luke.2.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>Among others Joseph went up from the town of Nazareth in Galilee to Bethlehem, the town of David, in Judea — because he belonged to the family and house of David —</span>
<span class="verse Luke_2_5" data-osis="Luke.2.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>To be registered with Mary, his engaged wife, who was about to become a mother.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_2_6" data-osis="Luke.2.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>While they were there her time came,</span>
<span class="verse Luke_2_7" data-osis="Luke.2.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>and she gave birth to her first child, a son. And because there was no room for them in the inn, she swathed him around and laid him in a manger.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_2_8" data-osis="Luke.2.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>In that same country-side were shepherds out in the open fields, watching their flocks that night,</span>
<span class="verse Luke_2_9" data-osis="Luke.2.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>when an angel of the Lord suddenly stood by them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them; and they were seized with fear.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_2_10" data-osis="Luke.2.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>“Have no fear,” the angel said. “For I bring you good news of a great joy in store for all the nation.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_2_11" data-osis="Luke.2.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>This day there has been born to you, in the town of David, a Savior, who is Christ and Lord.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_2_12" data-osis="Luke.2.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>And this will be the sign for you. You will find the infant swathed, and lying in a manger.”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Luke_2_13" data-osis="Luke.2.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>Then suddenly there appeared with the angel a multitude of the heavenly Host, praising God, and singing —<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
<span class="verse Luke_2_14" data-osis="Luke.2.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>“glory to God on high,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And on earth peace among those in whom he finds pleasure.”<br /><br /></span>
<span class="verse Luke_2_15" data-osis="Luke.2.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>Now, when the angels had left them and gone back to heaven, the shepherds said to one another: “Let us go at once to Bethlehem, and see this thing that has happened, of which the Lord has told us.”</span>
<span class="verse Luke_2_16" data-osis="Luke.2.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>So they went quickly, and found Mary and Joseph, and the infant lying in a manger;</span>
<span class="verse Luke_2_17" data-osis="Luke.2.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>and, when they saw it, they told of all that had been said to them about this child.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_2_18" data-osis="Luke.2.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>All who heard the shepherds were astonished at their story,</span>
<span class="verse Luke_2_19" data-osis="Luke.2.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>while Mary treasured up all that they said, and thought about it often in her thoughts.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_2_20" data-osis="Luke.2.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>And the shepherds went back, giving glory and praise to God for all that they had heard and seen, as it had been told them.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_2_21" data-osis="Luke.2.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>Eight days after the birth of the child, when it was time to circumcise him, he received the name Jesus — the name given him by the angel before his conception.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_2_22" data-osis="Luke.2.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>When the period of purification of mother and child, required by the law of Moses, came to an end, his parents took the child up to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord,</span>
<span class="verse Luke_2_23" data-osis="Luke.2.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>in compliance with the law of the Lord that ‘every first-born male will be dedicated to the Lord,’</span>
<span class="verse Luke_2_24" data-osis="Luke.2.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span>And also to offer the sacrifice required by the law of the Lord — ‘a pair of turtle-doves or two young pigeons.’</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Luke_2_25" data-osis="Luke.2.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span>There was at that time in Jerusalem a man named Simeon, a righteous and devout man, who lived in constant expectation of the Consolation of Israel, and under the guidance of the Holy Spirit.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_2_26" data-osis="Luke.2.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span>It had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he should not die until he had seen the Lord’s Christ.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_2_27" data-osis="Luke.2.27"><span class="verse-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span>Moved by the Spirit, Simeon came into the Temple Courts, and, when the parents brought in the child Jesus, to do for him what was customary under the law,</span>
<span class="verse Luke_2_28" data-osis="Luke.2.28"><span class="verse-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span>Simeon himself took the child in his arms, and blessed God, and said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
<span class="verse Luke_2_29" data-osis="Luke.2.29"><span class="verse-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span>“Now, Lord, you will let your servant go,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to your word, in peace,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
<span class="verse Luke_2_30" data-osis="Luke.2.30"><span class="verse-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span>for my eyes have seen the salvation<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
<span class="verse Luke_2_31" data-osis="Luke.2.31"><span class="verse-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span>Which you have prepared in the sight of all nations —<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
<span class="verse Luke_2_32" data-osis="Luke.2.32"><span class="verse-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span>A light to bring light to the Gentiles,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And to be the glory of your people Israel.”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Luke_2_33" data-osis="Luke.2.33"><span class="verse-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span>While the child’s father and mother were wondering at what was said about him,</span>
<span class="verse Luke_2_34" data-osis="Luke.2.34"><span class="verse-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span>Simeon gave them his blessing, and said to Mary, the child’s mother: “This child is appointed to be the cause of the fall and rise of many in Israel, and to be a sign much spoken against —</span>
<span class="verse Luke_2_35" data-osis="Luke.2.35"><span class="verse-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span>Yes, the sword will pierce your own heart — and so the thoughts in many minds will be disclosed.”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Luke_2_36" data-osis="Luke.2.36"><span class="verse-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span>There was also a Prophetess named Hannah, a daughter of Phanuel and of the tribe of Asher. She was far advanced in years, having lived with her husband for seven years after marriage,</span>
<span class="verse Luke_2_37" data-osis="Luke.2.37"><span class="verse-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span>and then a widow, until she had reached the age of eighty-four. She never left the Temple Courts, but, fasting and praying, worshiped God night and day.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_2_38" data-osis="Luke.2.38"><span class="verse-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span>At that moment she came up, and began publicly to thank God and to speak about the child to all who were looking for the deliverance of Jerusalem.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Luke_2_39" data-osis="Luke.2.39"><span class="verse-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span>When the child’s parents had done everything required by the law of the Lord, they returned to Galilee to their own town of Nazareth.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_2_40" data-osis="Luke.2.40"><span class="verse-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span>The child grew and became strong and wise, and the blessing of God was on him.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_2_41" data-osis="Luke.2.41"><span class="verse-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span>Every year the child’s parents used to go to Jerusalem at the Passover Festival.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_2_42" data-osis="Luke.2.42"><span class="verse-num v-42">42&nbsp;</span>When Jesus was twelve years old, they went according to custom to Jerusalem,</span>
<span class="verse Luke_2_43" data-osis="Luke.2.43"><span class="verse-num v-43">43&nbsp;</span>and had finished their visit; but, when they started to return, the boy Jesus remained behind in Jerusalem, without their knowing it.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_2_44" data-osis="Luke.2.44"><span class="verse-num v-44">44&nbsp;</span>Thinking that he was with their fellow travelers, they went one day’s journey before searching for him among their relations and acquaintances;</span>
<span class="verse Luke_2_45" data-osis="Luke.2.45"><span class="verse-num v-45">45&nbsp;</span>and then, as they did not find him, they returned to Jerusalem, searching everywhere for him.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_2_46" data-osis="Luke.2.46"><span class="verse-num v-46">46&nbsp;</span>It was not until the third day that they found him in the Temple Courts, sitting among the teachers, now listening to them, now asking them questions.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_2_47" data-osis="Luke.2.47"><span class="verse-num v-47">47&nbsp;</span>All who listened to him marveled at his intelligence and his answers.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Luke_2_48" data-osis="Luke.2.48"><span class="verse-num v-48">48&nbsp;</span>His parents were amazed when they saw him, and his mother said to him: “My child, why have you treated us like this? Your father and I have been searching for you in great distress.”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Luke_2_49" data-osis="Luke.2.49"><span class="verse-num v-49">49&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">“What made you search for me?”</span>he answered. <span class="woc">“Didn’t you know that I must be in my Father’s house?”</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_2_50" data-osis="Luke.2.50"><span class="verse-num v-50">50&nbsp;</span>His parents did not understand what he meant.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_2_51" data-osis="Luke.2.51"><span class="verse-num v-51">51&nbsp;</span>However he went down with them to Nazareth, and submitted himself to their control; and his mother treasured all that was said in her heart.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_2_52" data-osis="Luke.2.52"><span class="verse-num v-52">52&nbsp;</span>And Jesus grew in wisdom as he grew in years, and ‘gained the blessing of God and people.’</span>

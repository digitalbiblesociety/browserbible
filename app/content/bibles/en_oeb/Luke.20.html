<h2 class="chapter-num">20</h2>
<p>
<span class="verse Luke_20_1" data-osis="Luke.20.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>On one of these days, when Jesus was teaching the people in the Temple Courts and telling the good news, the chief priests and the teachers of the law, joined by the councillors, confronted him,</span>
<span class="verse Luke_20_2" data-osis="Luke.20.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>and addressing him, said: “Tell us what authority you have to do these things. Who is it who has given you this authority?”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Luke_20_3" data-osis="Luke.20.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">“I, too,”</span>said Jesus in reply, <span class="woc">“will ask you one question. Give me an answer to it.</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_20_4" data-osis="Luke.20.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">It is about John’s baptism — was it of divine or of human origin?”</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_20_5" data-osis="Luke.20.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>But they began arguing together: “If we say ‘divine,’ he will say ‘Why didn’t you believe him?’</span>
<span class="verse Luke_20_6" data-osis="Luke.20.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>But, if we say ‘human,’ the people will all stone us, for they are persuaded that John was a prophet.”</span>
<span class="verse Luke_20_7" data-osis="Luke.20.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>So they answered that they did not know its origin.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_20_8" data-osis="Luke.20.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">“Then I,”</span>said Jesus, <span class="woc">“refuse to tell you what authority I have to do these things.”</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Luke_20_9" data-osis="Luke.20.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>But Jesus began to tell the people this parable — <span class="woc">“A man once planted a vineyard, and then let it out to tenants, and went abroad for a long while.</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_20_10" data-osis="Luke.20.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">At the proper time he sent a servant to the tenants, so that they could give him a share of the produce of the vineyard. The tenants, however, beat him and sent him away empty-handed.</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_20_11" data-osis="Luke.20.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">The owner afterwards sent another servant; but the tenants beat and insulted this man too, and sent him away empty-handed.</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_20_12" data-osis="Luke.20.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">He sent a third; but they wounded this man also, and threw him outside.</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_20_13" data-osis="Luke.20.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">‘What should I do?’ said the owner of the vineyard. ‘I will send my son, who is very dear to me. Perhaps they will respect him.’</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_20_14" data-osis="Luke.20.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">But, on seeing him, the tenants consulted with one another. ‘Here is the heir!’ they said. ‘Let us kill him, and then the inheritance will become ours.’</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_20_15" data-osis="Luke.20.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">So they threw him outside the vineyard and killed him. Now what will the owner of the vineyard do to them?</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_20_16" data-osis="Luke.20.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">He will come and put those tenants to death, and will let the vineyard to others.”</span></span>
</p>
<p>“heaven forbid!” they exclaimed when they heard it.
<span class="verse Luke_20_17" data-osis="Luke.20.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>But Jesus looked at them and said: <span class="woc">“What then is the meaning of this passage? —<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘The  stone which the builders despised has now itself become the corner-stone.’</span><br /><br /></span>
<span class="verse Luke_20_18" data-osis="Luke.20.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Everyone who falls on that stone will be dashed to pieces, while anyone on whom it falls — it will scatter him as dust.”</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Luke_20_19" data-osis="Luke.20.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>After this the teachers of the law and the chief priest were eager to lay hands on Jesus then and there, but they were afraid of the people; for they saw that it was at them that he had aimed this parable.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_20_20" data-osis="Luke.20.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>Having watched their opportunity, they afterwards sent some spies, who pretended to be good men, to catch Jesus in the course of conversation, and so enable them to give him up to the Governor’s jurisdiction and authority.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_20_21" data-osis="Luke.20.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>These spies asked Jesus a question. They said: “Teacher, we know that you are right in what you say and teach, and that you do not take any account of a person’s position, but teach the way of God honestly;</span>
<span class="verse Luke_20_22" data-osis="Luke.20.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>are we right in paying tribute to the Emperor or not?”</span>
<span class="verse Luke_20_23" data-osis="Luke.20.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>Seeing through their deceitfulness, Jesus said to them:</span>
<span class="verse Luke_20_24" data-osis="Luke.20.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">“Show me a coin. Whose head and title are on it?”</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Luke_20_25" data-osis="Luke.20.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span>“The Emperor’s,” they said; and Jesus replied: <span class="woc">“Well then, pay to the Emperor what belongs to the Emperor, and to God what belongs to God.”</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_20_26" data-osis="Luke.20.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span>They could not lay hold of this answer before the people; and, in their wonder at his reply, they held their tongues.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_20_27" data-osis="Luke.20.27"><span class="verse-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span>Presently there came up some Sadducees, who maintain that there is no resurrection. Their question was this —</span>
<span class="verse Luke_20_28" data-osis="Luke.20.28"><span class="verse-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span>“Teacher, Moses laid down for us in his writings that —<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘Should a man’s married brother die, and should he be childless, the man should take the widow as his wife, and raise up a family for his brother.’<br /><br /></span>
<span class="verse Luke_20_29" data-osis="Luke.20.29"><span class="verse-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span>Well, there were once seven brothers; of whom the eldest, after taking a wife, died childless.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_20_30" data-osis="Luke.20.30"><span class="verse-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span>The second and third brothers both took her as their wife;</span>
<span class="verse Luke_20_31" data-osis="Luke.20.31"><span class="verse-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span>and so, too, did all seven — dying without children.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_20_32" data-osis="Luke.20.32"><span class="verse-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span>The woman herself was the last to die.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_20_33" data-osis="Luke.20.33"><span class="verse-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span>About the woman, then — at the resurrection, whose wife is she to be, all seven brothers having had her as their wife?”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Luke_20_34" data-osis="Luke.20.34"><span class="verse-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">“The men and women of this world,”</span>said Jesus, <span class="woc">“marry and are given in marriage;</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_20_35" data-osis="Luke.20.35"><span class="verse-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">but, for those who are thought worthy to attain to that other world and the resurrection from the dead, there is no marrying or being married,</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_20_36" data-osis="Luke.20.36"><span class="verse-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">nor indeed can they die again, for they are like angels and, having shared in the resurrection, they are God’s children.</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_20_37" data-osis="Luke.20.37"><span class="verse-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">As to the fact that the dead rise, even Moses indicated that, in the passage about the Bush, when he calls the Lord —<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘The God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.’</span><br /><br /></span>
<span class="verse Luke_20_38" data-osis="Luke.20.38"><span class="verse-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Now he is not God of dead people, but of living. For in his sight all are alive.”</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Luke_20_39" data-osis="Luke.20.39"><span class="verse-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span>“Well said, teacher!” exclaimed some of the teachers of the law,</span>
<span class="verse Luke_20_40" data-osis="Luke.20.40"><span class="verse-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span>for they did not venture to question him any further.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_20_41" data-osis="Luke.20.41"><span class="verse-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span>But Jesus said to them: <span class="woc">“How is it that people say that the Christ is to be David’s son?</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_20_42" data-osis="Luke.20.42"><span class="verse-num v-42">42&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">For David, in the book of Psalms, says himself —<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘The Lord said to my lord: “Sit at my right hand,</span><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
<span class="verse Luke_20_43" data-osis="Luke.20.43"><span class="verse-num v-43">43&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">until I put your enemies as a stool for your feet.”’</span><br /><br /></span>
<span class="verse Luke_20_44" data-osis="Luke.20.44"><span class="verse-num v-44">44&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">David, then, calls him ‘lord,’ so how is he David’s son?”</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Luke_20_45" data-osis="Luke.20.45"><span class="verse-num v-45">45&nbsp;</span>While all the people were listening, Jesus said to the disciples:</span>
<span class="verse Luke_20_46" data-osis="Luke.20.46"><span class="verse-num v-46">46&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">“Be on your guard against the teachers of the law, who delight to walk about in long robes, and like to be greeted in the streets with respect, and to have the best seats in the Synagogues, and places of honor at dinner.</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_20_47" data-osis="Luke.20.47"><span class="verse-num v-47">47&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">These are the men who rob widows of their houses, and make a pretense of saying long prayers. Their sentence will be all the heavier.”</span></span>

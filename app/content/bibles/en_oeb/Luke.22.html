<h2 class="chapter-num">22</h2>
<p>
<span class="verse Luke_22_1" data-osis="Luke.22.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>The feast of the unleavened bread, known as the Passover, was near.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_22_2" data-osis="Luke.22.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>The chief priest and the teachers of the law were looking for an opportunity of destroying Jesus, for they were afraid of the people.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Luke_22_3" data-osis="Luke.22.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>Now Satan took possession of Judas, who was known as Iscariot, and who belonged to the Twelve;</span>
<span class="verse Luke_22_4" data-osis="Luke.22.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>and he went and discussed with the chief priests and officers in charge at the Temple the best way of betraying Jesus to them.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_22_5" data-osis="Luke.22.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>They were glad of this, and agreed to pay him.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_22_6" data-osis="Luke.22.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>So Judas assented, and looked for an opportunity to betray Jesus to them, in the absence of a crowd.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Luke_22_7" data-osis="Luke.22.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>When the day of the Festival of the unleavened bread came, on which the Passover lambs had to be killed,</span>
<span class="verse Luke_22_8" data-osis="Luke.22.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>Jesus sent forward Peter and John, saying to them: <span class="woc">“Go and make preparations for our eating the Passover.”</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Luke_22_9" data-osis="Luke.22.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>“Where do you wish us to make preparations?” they asked.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_22_10" data-osis="Luke.22.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">“Listen,”</span>he answered, <span class="woc">“when you have got into the city, a man carrying a pitcher of water will meet you; follow him into whatever house he enters;</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_22_11" data-osis="Luke.22.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">and you will say to the owner of the house ‘The teacher says to you — Where is the room where I am to eat the Passover with my disciples?’</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_22_12" data-osis="Luke.22.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">The man will show you a large upstairs room, set out; there make preparations.”</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Luke_22_13" data-osis="Luke.22.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>So Peter and John went on, and found everything just as Jesus had told them, and they prepared the Passover.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Luke_22_14" data-osis="Luke.22.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>When the time came, Jesus took his place at the table, and the apostles with him.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_22_15" data-osis="Luke.22.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">“I have most earnestly wished,”</span>he said, <span class="woc">“to eat this Passover with you before I suffer.</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_22_16" data-osis="Luke.22.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">For I tell you that I will not eat it again, until it has had its fulfillment in the kingdom of God.”</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_22_17" data-osis="Luke.22.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>Then, on receiving a cup, after saying the thanksgiving, he said:</span>
<span class="verse Luke_22_18" data-osis="Luke.22.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">“Take this and share it among you. For I tell you that I will not, after today, drink of the juice of the grape, until the kingdom of God has come.”</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_22_19" data-osis="Luke.22.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>Then Jesus took some bread, and, after saying the thanksgiving, broke it and gave to them, with the words: <span class="woc">“This is my body.</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_22_20" data-osis="Luke.22.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_22_21" data-osis="Luke.22.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Yet see! The hand of the man who is betraying me is beside me on the table!</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_22_22" data-osis="Luke.22.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">True, the Son of Man is passing, by the way ordained for him, yet alas for that man by whom he is being betrayed!”</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_22_23" data-osis="Luke.22.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>Then they began questioning one another which of them it could be who was going to do this.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Luke_22_24" data-osis="Luke.22.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span>And a dispute arose among them as to which of them was to be regarded as the greatest.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_22_25" data-osis="Luke.22.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span>Jesus, however, said: <span class="woc">“The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their oppressors are styled ‘Benefactors.’</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_22_26" data-osis="Luke.22.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">But with you it must not be so. No, let the greatest among you become like the youngest, and him who leads like him who serves.</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_22_27" data-osis="Luke.22.27"><span class="verse-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Which is the greater — the master at the table or his servant? Is not it the master at the table? Yet I myself am among you as one who serves.</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_22_28" data-osis="Luke.22.28"><span class="verse-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">You are the men who have stood by me in my trials;</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_22_29" data-osis="Luke.22.29"><span class="verse-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">and, just as my Father has assigned me a kingdom, I assign you places,</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_22_30" data-osis="Luke.22.30"><span class="verse-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">so that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and be seated on twelve thrones as judges of the twelve tribes of Israel.</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_22_31" data-osis="Luke.22.31"><span class="verse-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Simon! Simon! listen. Satan demanded leave to sift you all like wheat,</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_22_32" data-osis="Luke.22.32"><span class="verse-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">but I prayed for you, Simon, that your faith should not fail. And you, when you have returned to me, are to strengthen the others.”</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Luke_22_33" data-osis="Luke.22.33"><span class="verse-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span>“Master,” said Peter, “with you I am ready to go both to prison and to death.”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Luke_22_34" data-osis="Luke.22.34"><span class="verse-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">“I tell you, Peter,”</span>replied Jesus, <span class="woc">“the cock will not crow today until you have disowned all knowledge of me three times.”</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_22_35" data-osis="Luke.22.35"><span class="verse-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span>Then he said to them all: <span class="woc">“When I sent you out as my messengers, without either purse, or bag, or sandals, were you in need of anything?”</span></span>
</p>
<p>“No; nothing,” they answered.
<span class="verse Luke_22_36" data-osis="Luke.22.36"><span class="verse-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">“Now, however,”</span>he said, <span class="woc">“he who has a purse must take it and his bag as well; and he who has not must sell his cloak and buy a sword.</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_22_37" data-osis="Luke.22.37"><span class="verse-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">For, I tell you, that passage of scripture must be fulfilled in me, which says — ‘He was counted among the godless’; indeed all that refers to me is finding its fulfillment.”</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Luke_22_38" data-osis="Luke.22.38"><span class="verse-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span>“Master,” they exclaimed, “look, here are two swords!”</span>
</p>
<p><span class="woc">“Enough!”</span>said Jesus.
<span class="verse Luke_22_39" data-osis="Luke.22.39"><span class="verse-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span>Jesus then went out, and made his way as usual to the Mount of Olives, followed by his disciples.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_22_40" data-osis="Luke.22.40"><span class="verse-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span>And, when he reached the spot, he said to them: <span class="woc">“Pray that you may not fall into temptation.”</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_22_41" data-osis="Luke.22.41"><span class="verse-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span>Then he withdrew about a stone’s throw, and knelt down and began to pray.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_22_42" data-osis="Luke.22.42"><span class="verse-num v-42">42&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">“Father,”</span>he said, <span class="woc">“if it is your pleasure, spare me this cup; only, not my will but your be done.”</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_22_43" data-osis="Luke.22.43"><span class="verse-num v-43">43&nbsp;</span>Presently there appeared to him an angel from heaven, who strengthened him.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_22_44" data-osis="Luke.22.44"><span class="verse-num v-44">44&nbsp;</span>And, as his anguish became intense, he prayed still more earnestly, while his sweat was like great drops of blood falling on the ground.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_22_45" data-osis="Luke.22.45"><span class="verse-num v-45">45&nbsp;</span>Then he rose from praying, and came to the disciples and found them sleeping for sorrow.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_22_46" data-osis="Luke.22.46"><span class="verse-num v-46">46&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">“Why are you asleep?”</span>he asked them. <span class="woc">“Rise and pray so that you don't fall into temptation.”</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_22_47" data-osis="Luke.22.47"><span class="verse-num v-47">47&nbsp;</span>While he was still speaking, a crowd appeared in sight, led by the man called Judas, who was one of the Twelve. Judas approached Jesus, to kiss him;</span>
<span class="verse Luke_22_48" data-osis="Luke.22.48"><span class="verse-num v-48">48&nbsp;</span>on which Jesus said to him: <span class="woc">“Judas, is it by a kiss that you betray the Son of Man?”</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_22_49" data-osis="Luke.22.49"><span class="verse-num v-49">49&nbsp;</span>But when those who were around Jesus saw what was going to happen, they exclaimed: “Master, should we use our swords?”</span>
<span class="verse Luke_22_50" data-osis="Luke.22.50"><span class="verse-num v-50">50&nbsp;</span>And one of them struck the high priest’s servant and cut off his right ear;</span>
<span class="verse Luke_22_51" data-osis="Luke.22.51"><span class="verse-num v-51">51&nbsp;</span>on which Jesus said: <span class="woc">“Let me at least do this”; and, touching his ear, he healed the wound.</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_22_52" data-osis="Luke.22.52"><span class="verse-num v-52">52&nbsp;</span>Then, turning to the chief priests and officers in charge at the Temple and councillors, who had come for him, he said: <span class="woc">“Have you come out, as if after a robber, with swords and clubs?</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_22_53" data-osis="Luke.22.53"><span class="verse-num v-53">53&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">When I was with you day after day in the Temple Courts, you did not lay hands on me; but now your time has come, and the power of darkness.”</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_22_54" data-osis="Luke.22.54"><span class="verse-num v-54">54&nbsp;</span>Those who had taken Jesus prisoner took him away into the house of the high priest. Peter followed at a distance.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_22_55" data-osis="Luke.22.55"><span class="verse-num v-55">55&nbsp;</span>But, when they had lit a fire in the centre of the courtyard and had all sat down there, Peter seated himself in the middle of them.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_22_56" data-osis="Luke.22.56"><span class="verse-num v-56">56&nbsp;</span>Presently a maidservant saw him sitting near the blaze of the fire. She looked carefully at him and said: “Why, this man was one of his companions!”</span>
<span class="verse Luke_22_57" data-osis="Luke.22.57"><span class="verse-num v-57">57&nbsp;</span>But Peter denied it. “I do not know him,” he replied.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_22_58" data-osis="Luke.22.58"><span class="verse-num v-58">58&nbsp;</span>A little while afterwards some one else — a man — saw him and said: “Why, you are one of them!”</span>
</p>
<p>“No,” Peter said, “I am not.”
<span class="verse Luke_22_59" data-osis="Luke.22.59"><span class="verse-num v-59">59&nbsp;</span>About an hour later another man declared positively: “This man also was certainly with him. Why, he is a Galilean!”</span>
<span class="verse Luke_22_60" data-osis="Luke.22.60"><span class="verse-num v-60">60&nbsp;</span>But Peter said: “I do not know what you are speaking about.” Instantly, while he was still speaking, a cock crowed.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_22_61" data-osis="Luke.22.61"><span class="verse-num v-61">61&nbsp;</span>And the Master turned and looked at Peter; and Peter remembered the words that the Master had said to him — <span class="woc">“Before a cock has crowed today, you will disown me three times”;</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_22_62" data-osis="Luke.22.62"><span class="verse-num v-62">62&nbsp;</span>and he went outside and wept bitterly.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_22_63" data-osis="Luke.22.63"><span class="verse-num v-63">63&nbsp;</span>The men who held Jesus kept making sport of him and beating him.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_22_64" data-osis="Luke.22.64"><span class="verse-num v-64">64&nbsp;</span>They blindfolded him and then questioned him. “Now play the prophet,” they said; “who was it that struck you?”</span>
<span class="verse Luke_22_65" data-osis="Luke.22.65"><span class="verse-num v-65">65&nbsp;</span>And they heaped many other insults on him.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_22_66" data-osis="Luke.22.66"><span class="verse-num v-66">66&nbsp;</span>At daybreak the National Council met — both the chief priests and the teachers of the law — and took Jesus before their High Council.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_22_67" data-osis="Luke.22.67"><span class="verse-num v-67">67&nbsp;</span>“If you are the Christ,” they said, “tell us so.”</span>
</p>
<p><span class="woc">“If I tell you,”</span>replied Jesus, <span class="woc">“you will not believe me;</span>
<span class="verse Luke_22_68" data-osis="Luke.22.68"><span class="verse-num v-68">68&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">and, if I question you, you will not answer.</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_22_69" data-osis="Luke.22.69"><span class="verse-num v-69">69&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">But from this hour ‘the Son of Man will be seated on the right hand of God Almighty.’”</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Luke_22_70" data-osis="Luke.22.70"><span class="verse-num v-70">70&nbsp;</span>“Are you, then, the Son of God?” they all asked. <span class="woc">“It is true,”</span>answered Jesus, <span class="woc">“I am.”</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_22_71" data-osis="Luke.22.71"><span class="verse-num v-71">71&nbsp;</span>At this they exclaimed: “Why do we want any more evidence? We have heard it ourselves from his own lips!”</span>

<h4>The Preparation</h4>
<span class="verse Luke_3_1" data-osis="Luke.3.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>In the fifteenth year of the reign of the Emperor Tiberius, when Pontius Pilate was Governor of Judea, Herod Ruler of Galilee, his brother Philip Ruler of the territory comprising Ituraea and Trachonitis, and Lysanias Ruler of Abilene,</span>
<span class="verse Luke_3_2" data-osis="Luke.3.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>and when Annas and Caiaphas were high priests, a command from God came to John, the son of Zechariah, while he was in the wilderness.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_3_3" data-osis="Luke.3.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>And John went through the whole district of the Jordan, proclaiming baptism on repentance, for the forgiveness of sins.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_3_4" data-osis="Luke.3.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>This was in fulfillment of what is said in the writings of the prophet Isaiah —<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘The voice of one crying aloud in the wilderness:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Make ready the way of the Lord,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make his paths straight.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
<span class="verse Luke_3_5" data-osis="Luke.3.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>Every chasm will be filled,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every mountain and hill will be leveled,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The winding ways will be straightened,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rough roads made smooth,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
<span class="verse Luke_3_6" data-osis="Luke.3.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>and everyone will see the salvation of God.”’<br /><br /></span>
<span class="verse Luke_3_7" data-osis="Luke.3.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>And John said to the crowds that went to be baptized by him: “You children of snakes! Who has prompted you to seek refuge from the coming judgment?</span>
<span class="verse Luke_3_8" data-osis="Luke.3.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>Let your lives, then, prove your repentance; and do not begin to say among yourselves ‘Abraham is our ancestor,’ for I tell you that out of these  stones God is able to raise descendants for Abraham!</span>
<span class="verse Luke_3_9" data-osis="Luke.3.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>Already, indeed, the axe is lying at the root of the trees. Therefore every tree that fails to bear good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire.”</span>
<p>
<span class="verse Luke_3_10" data-osis="Luke.3.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>“What are we to do then?” the people asked.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_3_11" data-osis="Luke.3.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>“Let anyone who has two coats,” answered John, “share with the person who has none; and anyone who has food do the same.”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Luke_3_12" data-osis="Luke.3.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>Even tax-gatherers came to be baptized, and said to John: “Teacher, what are we to do?”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Luke_3_13" data-osis="Luke.3.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>“Do not collect more than you have authority to demand,” John answered.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_3_14" data-osis="Luke.3.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>And when some soldiers on active service asked “And we — what are we to do?” he said: “Never use violence, or exact anything by false accusation; and be content with your pay.”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Luke_3_15" data-osis="Luke.3.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>Then, while the people were in suspense, and were all debating with themselves whether John could be the Christ,</span>
<span class="verse Luke_3_16" data-osis="Luke.3.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>John, addressing them all, said: “I, indeed, baptize you with water; but there is coming one more powerful than I, and I am not fit even to unfasten his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_3_17" data-osis="Luke.3.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>His winnowing-fan is in his hand so that he may clear his threshing-floor, and store the grain in his barn, but the chaff he will burn with a fire that cannot be put out.”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Luke_3_18" data-osis="Luke.3.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>And so with many different appeals John told his good news to the people.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_3_19" data-osis="Luke.3.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>But Prince Herod, being rebuked by John respecting Herodias, the wife of Herod’s brother, and for all the evil things that he had done,</span>
<span class="verse Luke_3_20" data-osis="Luke.3.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>crowned them all by shutting John up in prison.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_3_21" data-osis="Luke.3.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>Now after the baptism of all the people, and when Jesus had been baptized and was still praying, the heavens opened,</span>
<span class="verse Luke_3_22" data-osis="Luke.3.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>and the Holy Spirit came down on him in the form of a dove, and from the heavens came a voice — “You are my dearly loved son; you bring me great joy.”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Luke_3_23" data-osis="Luke.3.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>When beginning his work, Jesus was about thirty years old. He was regarded as the son of Joseph, whose ancestors were —<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eli,</span>

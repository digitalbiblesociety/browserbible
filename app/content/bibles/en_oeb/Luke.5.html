<h2 class="chapter-num">5</h2>
<p>
<span class="verse Luke_5_1" data-osis="Luke.5.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>Once, when the people were pressing around Jesus as they listened to God’s message, he happened to be standing by the shore of the Lake of Gennesaret, and saw two boats close to the shore.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_5_2" data-osis="Luke.5.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>The fishermen had gone away from them and were washing the nets.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_5_3" data-osis="Luke.5.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>So, getting into one of the boats, which belonged to Simon, Jesus asked him to push off a little way from the shore, and then sat down and taught the people from the boat.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_5_4" data-osis="Luke.5.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>When he had finished speaking, he said to Simon: <span class="woc">“Push off into deep water, and throw out your nets for a haul.”</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Luke_5_5" data-osis="Luke.5.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>“We have been hard at work all night, Sir,” answered Simon, “and have not caught anything, but, at your bidding, I will throw out the nets.”</span>
<span class="verse Luke_5_6" data-osis="Luke.5.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>They did so, and enclosed such a great shoal of fish that their nets began to break.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_5_7" data-osis="Luke.5.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>So they signaled to their partners in the other boat to come and help them; and they came and filled both the boats so full of fish that they were almost sinking.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_5_8" data-osis="Luke.5.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>When Simon Peter saw this, he threw himself down at Jesus’ knees, exclaiming: “Master, leave me, for I am a sinful man!”</span>
<span class="verse Luke_5_9" data-osis="Luke.5.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>For he and all who were with him were lost in amazement at the haul of fish which they had made;</span>
<span class="verse Luke_5_10" data-osis="Luke.5.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>and so, too, were James and John, Zebedee’s sons, who were Simon’s partners. <span class="woc">“Do not be afraid,”</span>Jesus said to Simon; <span class="woc">“from today you will catch people.”</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_5_11" data-osis="Luke.5.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>And, when they had brought their boats to shore, they left everything, and followed him.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_5_12" data-osis="Luke.5.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>On one occasion Jesus was staying in a town, when he saw a man who was covered with leprosy. When the leper saw Jesus, he threw himself on his face and implored his help: “Master, if only you are willing, you are able to make me clean.”</span>
<span class="verse Luke_5_13" data-osis="Luke.5.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>Stretching out his hand, Jesus touched him, saying as he did so: <span class="woc">“I am willing; become clean.”</span></span>
</p>
<p>Instantly the leprosy left the man;
<span class="verse Luke_5_14" data-osis="Luke.5.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>and then Jesus impressed on him that he was not to say a word to anyone, <span class="woc">“but,”</span>he added, <span class="woc">“set out and show yourself to the priest, and make the offerings for your cleansing, in the manner directed by Moses, as evidence of your cure.”</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_5_15" data-osis="Luke.5.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>However, the story about Jesus spread all the more, and great crowds came together to listen to him, and to be cured of their illnesses;</span>
<span class="verse Luke_5_16" data-osis="Luke.5.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>but Jesus used to withdraw to lonely places and pray.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Luke_5_17" data-osis="Luke.5.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>On one of those days, when Jesus was teaching, some Pharisees and Doctors of the law were sitting near by. (They had come from all the villages in Galilee and Judea, and from Jerusalem; and the power of the Lord was on Jesus, so that he could work cures.)</span>
<span class="verse Luke_5_18" data-osis="Luke.5.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>And there some men brought on a bed a man who was paralyzed. They tried to get him in and lay him before Jesus;</span>
<span class="verse Luke_5_19" data-osis="Luke.5.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>but, finding no way of getting him in owing to the crowd, they went up on the roof and lowered him through the tiles, with his pallet, into the middle of the people and in front of Jesus.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_5_20" data-osis="Luke.5.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>When he saw their faith, Jesus said: <span class="woc">“Friend, your sins have been forgiven you.”</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_5_21" data-osis="Luke.5.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>The teachers of the law and the Pharisees began debating about this. “Who is this man who speaks so blasphemously?” they asked. “Who can forgive sins except God?”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Luke_5_22" data-osis="Luke.5.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>When Jesus became aware of the way in which they were debating, he turned to them and exclaimed: <span class="woc">“What are you debating with yourselves?</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_5_23" data-osis="Luke.5.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Which is the easier? — to say ‘Your sins have been forgiven you’? Or to say ‘Get up, and walk’?</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_5_24" data-osis="Luke.5.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">But so that you may know that the Son of Man has power on earth to forgive sins”</span>—  he spoke to the paralyzed man — <span class="woc">“To you I say, Get up, and take up your pallet, and go to your home.”</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_5_25" data-osis="Luke.5.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span>Instantly the man stood up before their eyes, took up what he had been lying on, and went to his home, praising God.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_5_26" data-osis="Luke.5.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span>The people, one and all, were lost in amazement, and praised God; and in great awe they said: “We have seen marvelous things today!”</span>
<span class="verse Luke_5_27" data-osis="Luke.5.27"><span class="verse-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span>After this, Jesus went out; and he noticed a tax-gatherer, named Levi, sitting in the tax office, and said to him: <span class="woc">“Follow me.”</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_5_28" data-osis="Luke.5.28"><span class="verse-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span>Levi left everything and got up and followed him.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_5_29" data-osis="Luke.5.29"><span class="verse-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span>And Levi gave a great entertainment at his house, in honor of Jesus; and a large number of tax-gatherers and others were having dinner with them.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Luke_5_30" data-osis="Luke.5.30"><span class="verse-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span>The Pharisees and the teachers of the law belonging to their party complained of this to the disciples of Jesus.”</span>
<span class="verse Luke_5_31" data-osis="Luke.5.31"><span class="verse-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span>In answer Jesus said: <span class="woc">“It is not those who are well who need a doctor, but those who are ill.</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_5_32" data-osis="Luke.5.32"><span class="verse-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">I have not come to call the religious, but the outcast, to repent.”</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Luke_5_33" data-osis="Luke.5.33"><span class="verse-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span>“John’s disciples,” they said to Jesus, “Often fast and say prayers, and so do the disciples of the Pharisees, while yours are eating and drinking!”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Luke_5_34" data-osis="Luke.5.34"><span class="verse-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span>But Jesus answered them: <span class="woc">“Can you make the groom’s friends fast while the groom is with them?</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_5_35" data-osis="Luke.5.35"><span class="verse-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">But the days will come — a time when the groom will be taken away from them; and they will fast then, when those days come.”</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_5_36" data-osis="Luke.5.36"><span class="verse-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span>Then, as an illustration, Jesus said to them: <span class="woc">“No one ever tears a piece from a new garment and puts it on an old one; for, if they do, they will not only tear the new garment, but the piece from the new one will not match the old.</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_5_37" data-osis="Luke.5.37"><span class="verse-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">And no one puts new wine into old wine-skins; for, if they do, the new wine will burst the skins, and the wine itself will run out, and the skins be lost.</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_5_38" data-osis="Luke.5.38"><span class="verse-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">But new wine must be put into fresh skins.</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_5_39" data-osis="Luke.5.39"><span class="verse-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">No one after drinking old wine wishes for new. ‘No,’ they say, ‘the old is excellent.’”</span></span>

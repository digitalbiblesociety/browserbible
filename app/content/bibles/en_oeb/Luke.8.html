<h2 class="chapter-num">8</h2>
<p>
<span class="verse Luke_8_1" data-osis="Luke.8.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>Shortly afterwards, Jesus went on a journey through the towns and villages, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom of God. With him went the Twelve,</span>
<span class="verse Luke_8_2" data-osis="Luke.8.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>as well as some women who had been cured of wicked spirits and of infirmities. They were Mary, known as Mary of Magdala (from whom seven demons had been expelled),</span>
<span class="verse Luke_8_3" data-osis="Luke.8.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>and Joanna (the wife of Herod’s steward, Chuza), and Susannah, and many others — all of whom provided for Jesus and his apostles out of their own resources.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Luke_8_4" data-osis="Luke.8.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>Once, when a great crowd was collecting, and, when the people of town after town were flocking to Jesus, he spoke to them in the form of a parable:</span>
<span class="verse Luke_8_5" data-osis="Luke.8.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">“The sower went out to sow his seed; and, as he was sowing, some of the seed fell along the path and was trodden on; and the wild birds ate it up.</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_8_6" data-osis="Luke.8.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Other seed fell on rock, and, as soon as it began to grow, because it had no moisture, it withered away.</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_8_7" data-osis="Luke.8.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Other seed fell in the middle of brambles, but the brambles grew up with it and choked it entirely.</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_8_8" data-osis="Luke.8.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Other seed fell into rich soil, and grew, and gave a hundredfold return.”</span>After saying this, Jesus cried aloud: <span class="woc">“Let those who have ears to hear with hear.”</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Luke_8_9" data-osis="Luke.8.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>His disciples asked Jesus the meaning of this parable.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_8_10" data-osis="Luke.8.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">“To you,”</span>he said, <span class="woc">“the knowledge of the hidden truths of the kingdom of God has been imparted, but to others in parables only, so that ‘though they have eyes they may not see, and though they have ears, they may not understand.’</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_8_11" data-osis="Luke.8.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">This is the parable — The seed is God’s message.</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_8_12" data-osis="Luke.8.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">By the seed which fell along the path are meant those who hear the message; but then comes the devil and carries away the message from their minds, to prevent their believing it and being saved.</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_8_13" data-osis="Luke.8.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">By the seed which fell on the rock are meant those who, as soon as they hear the message, welcome it joyfully; but they have no root, and believe it only for a time, and, when the time of temptation comes, they draw back.</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_8_14" data-osis="Luke.8.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">By that which fell among the brambles are meant those who hear the message, but who, as they go on their way, are completely choked by this world’s cares and wealth and pleasures, and bring nothing to perfection.</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_8_15" data-osis="Luke.8.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">But by that in the good ground are meant those who, having heard the message, keep it in the good, rich soil of their hearts, and patiently yield a return.</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Luke_8_16" data-osis="Luke.8.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">No one sets light to a lamp and then covers it with a bowl or puts it underneath a couch, but they put it on a lamp-stand, so that anyone who comes in may see the light.</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_8_17" data-osis="Luke.8.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Nothing is hidden which will not be brought into the light of day, not ever kept hidden which will not some day become known and come into the light of day.</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_8_18" data-osis="Luke.8.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Take care, then, how you listen. For, to all those who have, more will be given; while, from all those who have nothing, even what they seem to have will be taken away.”</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_8_19" data-osis="Luke.8.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>Presently Jesus’ mother and brothers came where he was, but they were not able to join him because of the crowd.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_8_20" data-osis="Luke.8.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>So word was brought to him — ‘Your mother and your brothers are standing outside, wanting to see you.’</span>
<span class="verse Luke_8_21" data-osis="Luke.8.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>His reply, spoken to them all, was: <span class="woc">“My mother and my brothers are those who listen to God’s teaching and do what it says.”</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Luke_8_22" data-osis="Luke.8.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>One day about that time, Jesus got into a boat with his disciples and said to them: <span class="woc">“Let us go across the lake.”</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_8_23" data-osis="Luke.8.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>So they put off. While they were sailing, Jesus fell asleep. A squall swept down on the lake, and their boat was filling and they were in danger.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_8_24" data-osis="Luke.8.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span>So the disciples came and roused him. “Sir, Sir,” they cried, “we are lost!” Jesus rose and rebuked the wind and the rushing waves, and they fell, and a calm followed.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_8_25" data-osis="Luke.8.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">“Where is your faith?”</span>he exclaimed. But in great awe and amazement they said to one another: “Who can this be, who commands even the winds and the waves, and they obey him?”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Luke_8_26" data-osis="Luke.8.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span>And they reached the country of the Gerasenes, which is on the opposite side to Galilee;</span>
<span class="verse Luke_8_27" data-osis="Luke.8.27"><span class="verse-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span>and, on getting ashore, Jesus met a man, who had demons in him, coming out of the town. For a long time this man had worn no clothing, and he had not lived in a house, but in the tombs.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_8_28" data-osis="Luke.8.28"><span class="verse-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span>Catching sight of Jesus, he shrieked out and threw himself down before him, and in a loud voice exclaimed: “What do you want with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg you not to torment me.”</span>
<span class="verse Luke_8_29" data-osis="Luke.8.29"><span class="verse-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span>For Jesus was commanding the foul spirit to come out of the man. On many occasions it had seized him, and, even when secured with chains and fetters, and watched, he would break through anything that bound him, and be driven by the demon into the Wilds.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Luke_8_30" data-osis="Luke.8.30"><span class="verse-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">“What is your name?”</span>Jesus asked.</span>
</p>
<p>“Legion,” he answered (for many demons had taken possession of him);
<span class="verse Luke_8_31" data-osis="Luke.8.31"><span class="verse-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span>and the demons begged Jesus not to order them away into the bottomless pit.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_8_32" data-osis="Luke.8.32"><span class="verse-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span>There was a drove of many pigs close by feeding on the hill-side; and the demons begged Jesus to give them leave to enter into them. Jesus gave them leave.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_8_33" data-osis="Luke.8.33"><span class="verse-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span>They came out from the man and took possession of the pigs; and the drove rushed down the steep slope into the lake and were drowned.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_8_34" data-osis="Luke.8.34"><span class="verse-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span>When the men who tended them saw what had happened, they ran away, and carried the news to the town, and to the country around.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_8_35" data-osis="Luke.8.35"><span class="verse-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span>The people went out to see what had happened, and, when they came to Jesus, they found the man from whom the demons had gone out, sitting, clothed and in his right mind, at Jesus’ feet; and they were awe-struck.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_8_36" data-osis="Luke.8.36"><span class="verse-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span>Those who had seen it told them how the possessed man had been delivered.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_8_37" data-osis="Luke.8.37"><span class="verse-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span>Then all the people in the neighborhood of the Gerasenes asked Jesus to leave them, for they were terrified. Jesus got into a boat and returned.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_8_38" data-osis="Luke.8.38"><span class="verse-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span>The man from whom the demons had gone out begged Jesus to let him be with him; but Jesus sent him away.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_8_39" data-osis="Luke.8.39"><span class="verse-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">“Go back to your home,”</span>he said, <span class="woc">“and relate the story of all that God has done for you.” So the man went through the whole town and proclaimed, as he went, all that Jesus had done for him.</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_8_40" data-osis="Luke.8.40"><span class="verse-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span>On his return, Jesus was welcomed by the people; for everyone was looking out for him.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_8_41" data-osis="Luke.8.41"><span class="verse-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span>And a man named Jaeirus, who was a synagogue leader, came to Jesus, and threw himself at Jesus’ feet, with entreaties that he would come to his house,</span>
<span class="verse Luke_8_42" data-osis="Luke.8.42"><span class="verse-num v-42">42&nbsp;</span>because his only daughter, who was about twelve years old, was dying. As Jesus was going, the people were pressing closely around him.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_8_43" data-osis="Luke.8.43"><span class="verse-num v-43">43&nbsp;</span>And a woman, who had suffered from hemorrhage for twelve years, and whom no one could cure,</span>
<span class="verse Luke_8_44" data-osis="Luke.8.44"><span class="verse-num v-44">44&nbsp;</span>came up behind and touched the tassel of his cloak. Instantly the hemorrhage ceased.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Luke_8_45" data-osis="Luke.8.45"><span class="verse-num v-45">45&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">“Who touched me?”</span>Jesus asked; and, while everyone was denying having done so, Peter exclaimed: “Why, Sir, the people are crowding around you and pressing against you!”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Luke_8_46" data-osis="Luke.8.46"><span class="verse-num v-46">46&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">“Somebody touched me,”</span>said Jesus; <span class="woc">“for I felt that power had gone out from me.”</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_8_47" data-osis="Luke.8.47"><span class="verse-num v-47">47&nbsp;</span>Then the woman, when she saw that she was discovered, came forward trembling, and threw herself down before him; and, in the presence of all the people, she told him her reason for touching him, and that she had been cured instantly.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Luke_8_48" data-osis="Luke.8.48"><span class="verse-num v-48">48&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">“Daughter,”</span>he said, <span class="woc">“your faith has delivered you. Go, and peace be with you.”</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Luke_8_49" data-osis="Luke.8.49"><span class="verse-num v-49">49&nbsp;</span>Before he had finished speaking, some one came from the house of the synagogue leader and said: “Your daughter is dead! Do not trouble the teacher further.”</span>
<span class="verse Luke_8_50" data-osis="Luke.8.50"><span class="verse-num v-50">50&nbsp;</span>But Jesus, hearing this, spoke to the leader: <span class="woc">“Do not be afraid; only have faith, and she will yet be delivered.”</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_8_51" data-osis="Luke.8.51"><span class="verse-num v-51">51&nbsp;</span>When he reached the house, he did not allow anyone to go in with him, except Peter, John, and James, and the child’s father and mother.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_8_52" data-osis="Luke.8.52"><span class="verse-num v-52">52&nbsp;</span>And everyone was weeping and mourning for her.</span>
</p>
<p><span class="woc">“Do not weep,”</span>Jesus said, <span class="woc">“she is not dead; she is asleep.”</span>
<span class="verse Luke_8_53" data-osis="Luke.8.53"><span class="verse-num v-53">53&nbsp;</span>They began to laugh at him, for they knew that she was dead.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_8_54" data-osis="Luke.8.54"><span class="verse-num v-54">54&nbsp;</span>But, taking her by the hand, Jesus said in a loud voice: <span class="woc">“Child, rise!”</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_8_55" data-osis="Luke.8.55"><span class="verse-num v-55">55&nbsp;</span>The child’s spirit returned to her, and she instantly stood up; and Jesus ordered them to give her something to eat.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_8_56" data-osis="Luke.8.56"><span class="verse-num v-56">56&nbsp;</span>Her parents were amazed, but Jesus impressed on them that they were not to tell anyone what had happened.</span>

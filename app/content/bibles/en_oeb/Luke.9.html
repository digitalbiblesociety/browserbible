<h2 class="chapter-num">9</h2>
<p>
<span class="verse Luke_9_1" data-osis="Luke.9.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>Jesus called the Twelve together, and gave them power and authority over all demons, as well as to cure diseases.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_9_2" data-osis="Luke.9.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>He sent them out as his messengers, to proclaim the kingdom of God, and to work cures.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_9_3" data-osis="Luke.9.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">“Do not,”</span>he said to them, <span class="woc">“take anything for your journey; not even a staff, or a bag, or bread, or any silver, or a change of clothes with you.</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_9_4" data-osis="Luke.9.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Whatever house you go to stay in, remain there, and leave from that place.</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_9_5" data-osis="Luke.9.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">If people do not welcome you, as you leave that town, shake even the dust off your feet, as a protest against them.”</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_9_6" data-osis="Luke.9.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>Then they set out and went from village to village, telling the good news and curing people everywhere.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Luke_9_7" data-osis="Luke.9.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>Prince Herod heard of all that was happening, and was perplexed, because it was said by some that John must be risen from the dead.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_9_8" data-osis="Luke.9.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>Some again said that Elijah had appeared, and others that one of the old prophets had risen again.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_9_9" data-osis="Luke.9.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>But Herod himself said: “John I beheaded; but who is this of whom I hear such things?” And he endeavored to see him.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Luke_9_10" data-osis="Luke.9.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>When the apostles returned, they related to Jesus all that they had done. Then Jesus went privately to a town called Bethsaida, taking the apostles with him.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_9_11" data-osis="Luke.9.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>But the people recognized him and followed him in crowds; and Jesus welcomed them and spoke to them about the kingdom of God, while he cured those who were in need of help.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_9_12" data-osis="Luke.9.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>The day was drawing to a close, when the twelve came up to him, and said: “Send the crowd away, so that they may make their way to the villages and farms around about, and find themselves lodgings and provisions, for we are in a lonely spot here.”</span>
<span class="verse Luke_9_13" data-osis="Luke.9.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>But Jesus said: <span class="woc">“It is for you to give them something to eat.”</span></span>
</p>
<p>“We have not more than five loaves and two fishes,” they answered; “unless indeed we are to go and buy food for all these people.”
<span class="verse Luke_9_14" data-osis="Luke.9.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>(For the men among them were about five thousand.) <span class="woc">“Get them seated in companies,”</span>was his reply, <span class="woc">“about fifty in each.”</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_9_15" data-osis="Luke.9.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>This they did, and got all the people seated.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_9_16" data-osis="Luke.9.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>Taking the five loaves and the two fishes, Jesus looked up to heaven and said the blessing over them. Then he broke them in pieces, and gave them to his disciples to set before the people.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_9_17" data-osis="Luke.9.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>Everyone had sufficient to eat, and what was left of the broken pieces was picked up — twelve baskets.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Luke_9_18" data-osis="Luke.9.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>Afterwards, when Jesus was alone, praying, his disciples joined him, and he asked them this question — <span class="woc">“Who do the people say that I am?”</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Luke_9_19" data-osis="Luke.9.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>“John the Baptist,” was their answer; “others, however, say that you are Elijah, while others say that one of the old prophets has risen again.”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Luke_9_20" data-osis="Luke.9.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">“But you,”</span>he went on, <span class="woc">“who do you say that I am?”</span>And to this Peter answered: “The Christ of God.”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Luke_9_21" data-osis="Luke.9.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>Jesus, however, strictly charged them not to say this to anyone;</span>
<span class="verse Luke_9_22" data-osis="Luke.9.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>he told them that the Son of Man must undergo much suffering, and be rejected by the councillors, and chief priests, and teachers of the law, and be put to death, and rise on the third day.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_9_23" data-osis="Luke.9.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>And to all present he said: <span class="woc">“If any one wishes to walk in my steps, let them renounce self, and take up their cross daily, and follow me.</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_9_24" data-osis="Luke.9.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">For whoever wishes to save their life will lose it, and whoever, for my sake, loses his life — that person will save it.</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_9_25" data-osis="Luke.9.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">What good does it do someone if, when they has gained the whole world, they has lost or forfeited themselves?</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_9_26" data-osis="Luke.9.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Whoever is ashamed of me and of my teaching, the Son of Man will be ashamed of them, when he comes in his glory and the glory of the father and of the holy angels.</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_9_27" data-osis="Luke.9.27"><span class="verse-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Indeed, I tell you, some who are standing before me will not know death, until they have seen the kingdom of God.”</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_9_28" data-osis="Luke.9.28"><span class="verse-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span>About eight days after speaking these words, Jesus went up the mountain to pray, taking with him Peter, John, and James.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_9_29" data-osis="Luke.9.29"><span class="verse-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span>As he was praying, the aspect of his face was changed, and his clothing became of a glittering whiteness.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_9_30" data-osis="Luke.9.30"><span class="verse-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span>And all at once two men were talking with Jesus; they were Moses and Elijah,</span>
<span class="verse Luke_9_31" data-osis="Luke.9.31"><span class="verse-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span>who appeared in a glorified state, and spoke of his departure, which was destined to take place at Jerusalem.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_9_32" data-osis="Luke.9.32"><span class="verse-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span>Peter and his companions had been overpowered by sleep but, suddenly becoming wide awake, they saw Jesus glorified and the two men who were standing beside him.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Luke_9_33" data-osis="Luke.9.33"><span class="verse-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span>And, as Moses and Elijah were passing away from Jesus, Peter exclaimed: “Sir, it is good to be here; let us make three tents, one for you, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah.” He did not know what he was saying;</span>
<span class="verse Luke_9_34" data-osis="Luke.9.34"><span class="verse-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span>and, while he was speaking, a cloud came down and enveloped them; and they were afraid, as they passed into the cloud;</span>
<span class="verse Luke_9_35" data-osis="Luke.9.35"><span class="verse-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span>and from the cloud came a voice which said — “This is my Son, the Chosen One; him you must hear.”</span>
<span class="verse Luke_9_36" data-osis="Luke.9.36"><span class="verse-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span>And, as the voice ceased, Jesus was found alone. The apostles kept silence, and told no one about any of the things that they had seen.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_9_37" data-osis="Luke.9.37"><span class="verse-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span>The next day, when they had come down from the mountain, a great crowd met Jesus.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_9_38" data-osis="Luke.9.38"><span class="verse-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span>And just then a man in the crowd shouted out: “Teacher, I entreat you to look at my son, for he is my only child;</span>
<span class="verse Luke_9_39" data-osis="Luke.9.39"><span class="verse-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span>all at once a spirit will seize him, suddenly shriek out, and throw him into convulsions until he foams, and will leave him only when he is utterly exhausted.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_9_40" data-osis="Luke.9.40"><span class="verse-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span>I entreated your disciples to drive the spirit out, but they could not.”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Luke_9_41" data-osis="Luke.9.41"><span class="verse-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">“Faithless and perverse generation!”</span>Jesus exclaimed; <span class="woc">“how long must I be with you and have patience with you? Lead your son here.”</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_9_42" data-osis="Luke.9.42"><span class="verse-num v-42">42&nbsp;</span>While the boy was coming up to Jesus, the demon dashed him down and threw him into convulsions. But Jesus rebuked the foul spirit, and cured the boy, and gave him back to his father.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_9_43" data-osis="Luke.9.43"><span class="verse-num v-43">43&nbsp;</span>And all present were struck with awe at the majesty of God.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_9_44" data-osis="Luke.9.44"><span class="verse-num v-44">44&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">“Listen carefully to my words. For the Son of Man is destined to be betrayed into the hands of his fellow men.”</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_9_45" data-osis="Luke.9.45"><span class="verse-num v-45">45&nbsp;</span>But the disciples did not understand the meaning of this; it had been concealed from them so that they did not see it, and they were afraid to question him as to what he meant.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Luke_9_46" data-osis="Luke.9.46"><span class="verse-num v-46">46&nbsp;</span>A discussion arose among the disciples as to which of them was the greatest;</span>
<span class="verse Luke_9_47" data-osis="Luke.9.47"><span class="verse-num v-47">47&nbsp;</span>and Jesus, knowing of the discussion that was occupying their thoughts, took hold of a little child, and placed it beside him,</span>
<span class="verse Luke_9_48" data-osis="Luke.9.48"><span class="verse-num v-48">48&nbsp;</span>and then said to them: <span class="woc">“Anyone who, for the sake of my name, welcomes even this little child is welcoming me; and anyone who welcomes me is welcoming him who sent me as his messenger. For whoever is least among you all — that person is great.”</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Luke_9_49" data-osis="Luke.9.49"><span class="verse-num v-49">49&nbsp;</span>John said: “Sir, we saw a man driving out demons by using your name, and we tried to prevent him, because he does not follow you with us.”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Luke_9_50" data-osis="Luke.9.50"><span class="verse-num v-50">50&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">“None of you must prevent him,”</span>Jesus said to John; <span class="woc">“whoever’s not against you is for you.”</span></span>
</p>
<h4>The Journey to Jerusalem</h4>
<span class="verse Luke_9_51" data-osis="Luke.9.51"><span class="verse-num v-51">51&nbsp;</span>As the days before his being taken up to heaven were growing few, Jesus set his face resolutely in the direction of Jerusalem; and he sent on messengers in advance.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_9_52" data-osis="Luke.9.52"><span class="verse-num v-52">52&nbsp;</span>On their way, they went into a Samaritan village to make preparations for him,</span>
<span class="verse Luke_9_53" data-osis="Luke.9.53"><span class="verse-num v-53">53&nbsp;</span>but the people there did not welcome him, because his face was set in the direction of Jerusalem.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_9_54" data-osis="Luke.9.54"><span class="verse-num v-54">54&nbsp;</span>When James and John saw this, they said: “Master, do you wish us to call for fire to come down from the heavens and consume them?”</span>
<span class="verse Luke_9_55" data-osis="Luke.9.55"><span class="verse-num v-55">55&nbsp;</span>But Jesus turned and rebuked them.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_9_56" data-osis="Luke.9.56"><span class="verse-num v-56">56&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">And they made their way to another village.</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_9_57" data-osis="Luke.9.57"><span class="verse-num v-57">57&nbsp;</span>And, while they were on their way, a man said to Jesus: “I will follow you wherever you go.”</span>
<p>
<span class="verse Luke_9_58" data-osis="Luke.9.58"><span class="verse-num v-58">58&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">“Foxes have holes,”</span>he replied, <span class="woc">“and wild birds their nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head.”</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_9_59" data-osis="Luke.9.59"><span class="verse-num v-59">59&nbsp;</span>To another man Jesus said: <span class="woc">“Follow me.”</span></span>
</p>
<p>“Let me first go and bury my father,” said the man.
<span class="verse Luke_9_60" data-osis="Luke.9.60"><span class="verse-num v-60">60&nbsp;</span>But Jesus said: <span class="woc">“Leave the dead to bury their dead; but go yourself and carry far and wide the news of the kingdom of God.”</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Luke_9_61" data-osis="Luke.9.61"><span class="verse-num v-61">61&nbsp;</span>“Master,” said another, “I will follow you; but first let me say goodbye to my family.”</span>
<span class="verse Luke_9_62" data-osis="Luke.9.62"><span class="verse-num v-62">62&nbsp;</span>But Jesus answered: <span class="woc">“No one who looks back, after putting their hand to the plow, is fitted for the kingdom of God.”</span></span>

<h4>The Last Days</h4>
<span class="verse Mark_11_1" data-osis="Mark.11.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>When they had almost reached Jerusalem, as far as Bethphage and Bethany, near the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent on two of his disciples.</span>
<span class="verse Mark_11_2" data-osis="Mark.11.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">“Go to the village facing you,”</span>he said; <span class="woc">“and, as soon as you get there, you will find a foal tethered, which no one has ever ridden; untie it, and bring it.</span></span>
<span class="verse Mark_11_3" data-osis="Mark.11.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">And, if anyone says to you ‘Why are you doing that?’, say ‘The Master wants it, and will be sure to send it back here at once.’”</span></span>
<span class="verse Mark_11_4" data-osis="Mark.11.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>The two disciples went, and, finding a foal tethered outside a door in the street, they untied it.</span>
<span class="verse Mark_11_5" data-osis="Mark.11.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>Some of the bystanders said to them: “What are you doing, untying the foal?”</span>
<span class="verse Mark_11_6" data-osis="Mark.11.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>And the two disciples answered as Jesus had told them; and they allowed them to go.</span>
<span class="verse Mark_11_7" data-osis="Mark.11.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>Then they brought the foal to Jesus, and, when they had laid their cloaks on it, he seated himself on it.</span>
<span class="verse Mark_11_8" data-osis="Mark.11.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>Many of the people spread their cloaks on the road, while some strewed boughs which they had cut from the fields;</span>
<span class="verse Mark_11_9" data-osis="Mark.11.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>and those who led the way, as well as those who followed, kept shouting: “‘God save him! Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord!’</span>
<span class="verse Mark_11_10" data-osis="Mark.11.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>Blessed is the coming kingdom of our father David! ‘God save him from on high!’”</span>
<p>
<span class="verse Mark_11_11" data-osis="Mark.11.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>Jesus entered Jerusalem, and went into the Temple Courts; and, after looking around at everything, as it was already late, he went out to Bethany with the Twelve.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Mark_11_12" data-osis="Mark.11.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>The next day, after they had left Bethany, Jesus became hungry;</span>
<span class="verse Mark_11_13" data-osis="Mark.11.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>and, noticing a fig-tree at a distance in leaf, he went to it to see if by any chance he could find something on it; but, on coming up to it, he found nothing but leaves, for it was not the season for figs.</span>
<span class="verse Mark_11_14" data-osis="Mark.11.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>So, addressing the tree, he exclaimed: <span class="woc">“May no one ever again eat of your fruit!”</span>And his disciples heard what he said.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Mark_11_15" data-osis="Mark.11.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>They came to Jerusalem. Jesus went into the Temple Courts, and began to drive out those who were buying and selling there. He overturned the tables of the money changers, and the seats of the pigeon-dealers,</span>
<span class="verse Mark_11_16" data-osis="Mark.11.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>and would not allow anyone to carry anything across the Temple Courts.</span>
<span class="verse Mark_11_17" data-osis="Mark.11.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>Then he began to teach. <span class="woc">“Does not scripture say,”</span>he asked, <span class="woc">“‘My house will be called a house of prayer for all the nations’? But you have made it a den of robbers.’”</span></span>
<span class="verse Mark_11_18" data-osis="Mark.11.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>Now the chief priests and the teachers of the law heard this and began to look for some way of putting Jesus to death; for they were afraid of him, since all the people were greatly impressed by his teaching.</span>
<span class="verse Mark_11_19" data-osis="Mark.11.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>As soon as evening fell, Jesus and his disciples went out of the city.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Mark_11_20" data-osis="Mark.11.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>As they passed by early in the morning, they noticed that the fig-tree was withered up from the  roots.</span>
<span class="verse Mark_11_21" data-osis="Mark.11.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>Then Peter recalled what had occurred. “Look, Rabbi,” he exclaimed, “the fig-tree which you doomed is withered up!”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Mark_11_22" data-osis="Mark.11.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">“Have faith in God!”</span>replied Jesus.</span>
<span class="verse Mark_11_23" data-osis="Mark.11.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">“I tell you that if anyone should say to this hill ‘Be lifted up and hurled into the sea!’, without ever a doubt in his mind, but in the faith that what he says will be done, he would find that it would be.</span></span>
<span class="verse Mark_11_24" data-osis="Mark.11.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">And therefore I say to you ‘Have faith that whatever you ask for in prayer is already granted you, and you will find that it will be.’</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Mark_11_25" data-osis="Mark.11.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">‘And, whenever you stand up to pray, forgive any grievance that you have against anyone, so that your Father who is in heaven also may forgive you your offenses.”</span></span>
<span class="verse Mark_11_27" data-osis="Mark.11.27"><span class="verse-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span>They came to Jerusalem again. While Jesus was walking about in the Temple Courts, the chief priests, the teachers of the law, and the councillors came up to him.</span>
<span class="verse Mark_11_28" data-osis="Mark.11.28"><span class="verse-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span>“What authority have you to do these things?” they said. “Who gave you the authority to do them?”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Mark_11_29" data-osis="Mark.11.29"><span class="verse-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">“I will put one question to you,”</span>said Jesus. <span class="woc">“Answer me that, and then I will tell you what authority I have to act as I do.</span></span>
<span class="verse Mark_11_30" data-osis="Mark.11.30"><span class="verse-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">It is about John’s baptism. Was it of divine or human origin? Answer me that.”</span></span>
<span class="verse Mark_11_31" data-osis="Mark.11.31"><span class="verse-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span>They began arguing together; “If we say ‘divine,’ he will say ‘Why then didn’t you believe him?’</span>
<span class="verse Mark_11_32" data-osis="Mark.11.32"><span class="verse-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span>Yet can we say ‘human’?” — They were afraid of the people, for everyone regarded John as undoubtedly a prophet.</span>
<span class="verse Mark_11_33" data-osis="Mark.11.33"><span class="verse-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span>So their answer to Jesus was — “We do not know.”</span>
</p>
<p><span class="woc">“Then I,”</span>replied Jesus, <span class="woc">“refuse to tell you what authority I have to do these things.”</span>

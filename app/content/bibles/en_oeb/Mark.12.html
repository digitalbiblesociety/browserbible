<h2 class="chapter-num">12</h2>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.12.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>And Jesus began to speak to them in parables: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;A man once planted a vineyard, put a fence round it, dug a wine-press, built a tower, and then let it out to tenants and went abroad.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.12.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> At the proper time he sent a servant to the tenants, to receive from them a share of the produce of the vintage;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.12.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> but they seized him, and beat him, and sent him away empty- handed.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.12.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> A second time the owner sent a servant to them; this man, too, the tenants struck on the head, and insulted.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.12.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> He sent another, but him they killed; and so with many others- -some they beat and some they killed.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.12.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> He had still one son, who was very dear to him; and him he sent to them last of all. &lsquo;They will respect my son,&rsquo; he said.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.12.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> But those tenants said to one another &lsquo;Here is the heir! Come, let us kill him, and his inheritance will be ours.&rsquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.12.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> So they seized him, and killed him, and threw his body outside the vineyard.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.12.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> What will the owner of the vineyard do? He will come and put the tenants to death, and he will let the vineyard to others.</span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.12.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &lsquo;Have you never read this passage of Scripture? &mdash; &lsquo;The very stone which the builders despised has now itself become the corner-stone;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.12.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> this corner-stone has come from the Lord, and is marvellous in our eyes.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.12.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>After this his enemies were eager to arrest him, but they were afraid of the crowd; for they saw that it was at them that he had aimed the parable. So they let him alone, and went away.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.12.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>Afterwards they sent to Jesus some of the Pharisees and of the Herodians, to set a trap for him in the course of conversation.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.12.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>These men came to him and said: &ldquo;Teacher, we know that you are an honest man, and are not afraid of any one, for you pay no regard to a person&rsquo;s position, but teach the Way of God honestly; are we right in paying taxes to the Emperor, or not?</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.12.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>Should we pay, or should we not pay?&rdquo; Knowing their hypocrisy, Jesus said to them: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Why are you testing me? Bring me a florin to look at.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.12.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span>And, when they had brought it, he asked: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Whose head and title are these?&rdquo;</span>  &ldquo;The Emperor&rsquo;s,&rdquo; they said;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.12.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span>and Jesus replied: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Pay to the Emperor what belongs to the Emperor, and to God what belongs to God.&rdquo;</span>  And they wondered at him.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.12.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span>Next came some Sadducees &mdash; the men who maintain that there is no resurrection. Their question was this &mdash;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.12.19"><span class="verse-num">19&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Teacher, in our Scriptures Moses decreed that, should a man&rsquo;s brother die, leaving a widow but no child, the man should take the widow as his wife, and raise up a family for his brother.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.12.20"><span class="verse-num">20&nbsp;</span>There were once seven brothers; of whom the eldest took a wife, but died and left no family;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.12.21"><span class="verse-num">21&nbsp;</span>and the second took her, and died without family; and so did the third.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.12.22"><span class="verse-num">22&nbsp;</span>All the seven died and left no family. The woman herself died last of all.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.12.23"><span class="verse-num">23&nbsp;</span>At the resurrection whose wife will she be, all seven brothers having had her as their wife?&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.12.24"><span class="verse-num">24&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;Is not the reason of your mistake,&rdquo;</span>  answered Jesus, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;your ignorance of the Scriptures and of the power of God?</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.12.25"><span class="verse-num">25&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> When men rise from the dead, there is no marrying or being married; but they are as angels in Heaven.</span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.12.26"><span class="verse-num">26&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;As to the dead, and the fact that they rise, have you never read in the Book of Moses, in the passage about the Bush, how God spoke to him thus &mdash; &lsquo;I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob&rsquo;?</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.12.27"><span class="verse-num">27&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> He is not God of dead men, but of living. You are greatly mistaken.&rdquo;</span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.12.28"><span class="verse-num">28&nbsp;</span>Then came up one of the Teachers of the Law who had heard their discussions. Knowing that Jesus had answered them wisely, he asked him this question: &ldquo;What is the first of all the commandments?&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.12.29"><span class="verse-num">29&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;The first,&rdquo;</span>  answered Jesus, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;is &mdash; &lsquo;Hear, O Israel; the Lord our God is the one Lord;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.12.30"><span class="verse-num">30&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> and thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength.&rsquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.12.31"><span class="verse-num">31&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> The second is this &mdash; &lsquo;Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thou dost love thyself.&rsquo; There is no commandment greater than these.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.12.32"><span class="verse-num">32&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Wisely answered, Teacher!&rdquo; exclaimed the Teacher of the Law. &ldquo;It is true, as you say, that &lsquo;there is one God,&rsquo; and that &lsquo;there is no other besides him&rsquo;;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.12.33"><span class="verse-num">33&nbsp;</span>and to &lsquo;love him with all one&rsquo;s heart, and with all one&rsquo;s understanding, and with all one&rsquo;s strength,&rsquo; and to &lsquo;love one&rsquo;s neighbour as one loves oneself&rsquo; is far beyond all &lsquo;burnt-offerings and sacrifices.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.12.34"><span class="verse-num">34&nbsp;</span>Seeing that he had answered with discernment, Jesus said to him: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;You are not far from the Kingdom of God.&rdquo;</span></span>

</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.12.35"><span class="verse-num">35&nbsp;</span>While Jesus was teaching in the Temple Courts, he asked: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;How is it that the Teachers of the Law say that the Christ is to be David&rsquo;s son?</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.12.36"><span class="verse-num">36&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> David said himself, speaking under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit &mdash;  &lsquo;The Lord said to my lord: &ldquo;Sit at my right hand, until I put thy enemies beneath thy feet.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.12.37"><span class="verse-num">37&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> David himself calls him &lsquo;lord,&rsquo; how comes it, then, that he is to be his son?&rdquo;</span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.12.38"><span class="verse-num">38&nbsp;</span>In the course of his teaching, Jesus said: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;See that you are on your guard against the Teachers of the Law, who delight to walk about in long robes, and to be greeted in the streets with respect,</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.12.39"><span class="verse-num">39&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> and to have the best seats in the Synagogues, and places of honour at dinner.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.12.40"><span class="verse-num">40&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> They are the men that rob widows of their homes, and make a pretence of saying long prayers. Their sentence will be all the heavier.&rdquo;</span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.12.41"><span class="verse-num">41&nbsp;</span>Then Jesus sat down opposite the chests for the Temple offerings, and watched how the people put money into them. Many rich people were putting in large sums;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.12.42"><span class="verse-num">42&nbsp;</span>but one poor widow came and put in two farthings, which make a half-penny.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.12.43"><span class="verse-num">43&nbsp;</span>On this, calling his disciples to him, Jesus said: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;I tell you that this poor widow has put in more than all the others who were putting money into the chests;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.12.44"><span class="verse-num">44&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> for every one else put in something from what he had to spare, while she, in her need, put in all she had &mdash; everything that she had to live on.&rdquo;</span></span>

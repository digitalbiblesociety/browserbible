<h2 class="chapter-num">15</h2>
<p>
<span class="verse Mark_15_1" data-osis="Mark.15.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>As soon as it was daylight, the chief priests, after holding a consultation with the councillors and teachers of the law — that is to say, the whole High Council — put Jesus in chains, and took him away, and gave him up to Pilate.</span>
<span class="verse Mark_15_2" data-osis="Mark.15.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>“Are you the king of the Jews?” asked Pilate. <span class="woc">“It is true,”</span>replied Jesus.</span>
<span class="verse Mark_15_3" data-osis="Mark.15.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>Then the chief priests brought a number of charges against him.</span>
<span class="verse Mark_15_4" data-osis="Mark.15.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>So Pilate questioned Jesus again. “Have you no reply to make?” he asked. “Listen, how many charges they are bringing against you.”</span>
<span class="verse Mark_15_5" data-osis="Mark.15.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>But Jesus still made no reply whatever; at which Pilate was astonished.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Mark_15_6" data-osis="Mark.15.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>Now, at the feast, Pilate used to grant the people the release of any one prisoner whom they might ask for.</span>
<span class="verse Mark_15_7" data-osis="Mark.15.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>A man called Barabbas was in prison, with the rioters who had committed murder during a riot.</span>
<span class="verse Mark_15_8" data-osis="Mark.15.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>So, when the crowd went up and began to ask Pilate to follow his usual custom,</span>
<span class="verse Mark_15_9" data-osis="Mark.15.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>he answered: “Do you want me to release the ‘king of the Jews’ for you?”</span>
<span class="verse Mark_15_10" data-osis="Mark.15.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>For he was aware that it was out of jealousy that the chief priests had given Jesus up to him.</span>
<span class="verse Mark_15_11" data-osis="Mark.15.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>But the chief priests incited the crowd to get Barabbas released instead.</span>
<span class="verse Mark_15_12" data-osis="Mark.15.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>Pilate, however, spoke to them again: “What should I do then with the man whom you call the ‘king of the Jews’?”</span>
<span class="verse Mark_15_13" data-osis="Mark.15.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>Again they shouted: “Crucify him!”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Mark_15_14" data-osis="Mark.15.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>“Why, what harm has he done?” Pilate kept saying to them. But they shouted furiously: “Crucify him!”</span>
<span class="verse Mark_15_15" data-osis="Mark.15.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>And Pilate, wishing to satisfy the crowd, released Barabbas to them, and, after scourging Jesus, gave him up to be crucified.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Mark_15_16" data-osis="Mark.15.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>The soldiers then took Jesus away into the courtyard — that is the Government house — and they called the whole garrison together.</span>
<span class="verse Mark_15_17" data-osis="Mark.15.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>They dressed him in a purple robe, and, having twisted a crown of thorns, put it on him,</span>
<span class="verse Mark_15_18" data-osis="Mark.15.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>and then began to salute him. “Long life to you, king of the Jews!” they said.</span>
<span class="verse Mark_15_19" data-osis="Mark.15.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>And they kept striking him on the head with a rod, spitting at him, and bowing to the ground before him — going down on their knees;</span>
<span class="verse Mark_15_20" data-osis="Mark.15.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>and, when they had left off mocking him, they took off the purple robe, and put his own clothes on him.</span>
<span class="verse Mark_15_21" data-osis="Mark.15.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>They led Jesus out to crucify him; and they compelled a passer-by, Simon from Cyrene, who was on his way in from the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to go with them to carry his cross.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Mark_15_22" data-osis="Mark.15.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>They brought Jesus to the place which was known as Golgotha — a name which means ‘place of a Skull.’</span>
<span class="verse Mark_15_23" data-osis="Mark.15.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>There they offered him drugged wine; but Jesus refused it.</span>
<span class="verse Mark_15_24" data-osis="Mark.15.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span>Then they crucified him, and divided his clothes among them, casting lots for them, to settle what each should take.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Mark_15_25" data-osis="Mark.15.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span>It was nine in the morning when they crucified him.</span>
<span class="verse Mark_15_26" data-osis="Mark.15.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span>The words of the charge against him, written up over his head, read — ‘THE KING OF THE JEWS.’</span>
<span class="verse Mark_15_27" data-osis="Mark.15.27"><span class="verse-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span>And with him they crucified two robbers, one on the right, and the other on the left.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Mark_15_29" data-osis="Mark.15.29"><span class="verse-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span>The passers-by railed at him, shaking their heads, as they said: “Ah! You who would destroy the Temple and build one in three days,</span>
<span class="verse Mark_15_30" data-osis="Mark.15.30"><span class="verse-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span>come down from the cross and save yourself!”</span>
<span class="verse Mark_15_31" data-osis="Mark.15.31"><span class="verse-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span>In the same way the chief priests, with the teachers of the law, said to one another in mockery:</span>
<span class="verse Mark_15_32" data-osis="Mark.15.32"><span class="verse-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span>“He saved others, but he cannot save himself! Let the Christ, the ‘king of Israel,’ come down from the cross now so that we can see it and believe.” Even the men who had been crucified with Jesus insulted him.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Mark_15_33" data-osis="Mark.15.33"><span class="verse-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span>At midday, a darkness came over the whole country, lasting until three in the afternoon.</span>
<span class="verse Mark_15_34" data-osis="Mark.15.34"><span class="verse-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span>And, at three, Jesus called out loudly: <span class="woc">‘Eloi, Eloi, lama sabacthani?’”</span>which means <span class="woc">‘My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?’</span></span>
<span class="verse Mark_15_35" data-osis="Mark.15.35"><span class="verse-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span>Some of those standing around heard this, and said: “Listen! He is calling for Elijah!”</span>
<span class="verse Mark_15_36" data-osis="Mark.15.36"><span class="verse-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span>And a man ran, and, soaking a sponge in common wine, put it on the end of a rod, and offered it to him to drink, saying as he did so: “Wait and let us see if Elijah is coming to take him down.”</span>
<span class="verse Mark_15_37" data-osis="Mark.15.37"><span class="verse-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span>But Jesus, giving a loud cry, expired.</span>
<span class="verse Mark_15_38" data-osis="Mark.15.38"><span class="verse-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span>The Temple curtain was torn in two from top to bottom.</span>
<span class="verse Mark_15_39" data-osis="Mark.15.39"><span class="verse-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span>The Roman officer, who was standing facing Jesus, on seeing the way in which he expired, exclaimed: “This man must indeed have been ‘God’s Son’!”</span>
<span class="verse Mark_15_40" data-osis="Mark.15.40"><span class="verse-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span>There were some women also watching from a distance, among them being Mary of Magdala, Mary the mother of James the Little and of Joseph, and Salome —</span>
<span class="verse Mark_15_41" data-osis="Mark.15.41"><span class="verse-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span>all of whom used to accompany Jesus when he was in Galilee, and attend on him — besides many other women who had come up with him to Jerusalem.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Mark_15_42" data-osis="Mark.15.42"><span class="verse-num v-42">42&nbsp;</span>The evening had already fallen, when, as it was the Preparation day — the day before the Sabbath —</span>
<span class="verse Mark_15_43" data-osis="Mark.15.43"><span class="verse-num v-43">43&nbsp;</span>Joseph from Ramah, a Councillor of good position, who was himself living in expectation of the kingdom of God, came and ventured to go in to see Pilate, and to ask for the body of Jesus.</span>
<span class="verse Mark_15_44" data-osis="Mark.15.44"><span class="verse-num v-44">44&nbsp;</span>But Pilate was surprised to hear that he had already died. So he sent for the officer, and asked if he were already dead;</span>
<span class="verse Mark_15_45" data-osis="Mark.15.45"><span class="verse-num v-45">45&nbsp;</span>and, on learning from the officer that it was so, he gave the corpse to Joseph.</span>
<span class="verse Mark_15_46" data-osis="Mark.15.46"><span class="verse-num v-46">46&nbsp;</span>Joseph, having bought a linen sheet, took Jesus down, and wound the sheet around him, and laid him in a tomb which had been cut out of the rock; and then rolled a stone up against the entrance of the tomb.</span>
<span class="verse Mark_15_47" data-osis="Mark.15.47"><span class="verse-num v-47">47&nbsp;</span>Mary of Magdala and Mary, the mother of Joseph, were watching to see where he was laid.</span>

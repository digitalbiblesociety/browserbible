<p>
<span class="verse Mark_2_1" data-osis="Mark.2.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>Some days later, when Jesus came back to Capernaum, the news spread that he was in a house there;</span>
<span class="verse Mark_2_2" data-osis="Mark.2.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>and so many people collected together, that after a while there was no room for them even around the door; and he began to tell them his message.</span>
<span class="verse Mark_2_3" data-osis="Mark.2.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>Some people came, bringing to him a paralyzed man, who was being carried by four of them.</span>
<span class="verse Mark_2_4" data-osis="Mark.2.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>Being, however, unable to get him near to Jesus, owing to the crowd, they removed the roofing above Jesus; and, when they had made an opening, they let down the mat on which the paralyzed man was lying.</span>
<span class="verse Mark_2_5" data-osis="Mark.2.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the man: <span class="woc">“Child, your sins are forgiven.”</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Mark_2_6" data-osis="Mark.2.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>But some of the teachers of the law who were sitting there were debating in their minds:</span>
<span class="verse Mark_2_7" data-osis="Mark.2.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>“Why does this man speak like this? He is blaspheming! Who can forgive sins except God?”</span>
<span class="verse Mark_2_8" data-osis="Mark.2.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>Jesus, at once intuitively aware that they were debating with themselves in this way, said to them: <span class="woc">“Why are you debating in your minds about this?</span></span>
<span class="verse Mark_2_9" data-osis="Mark.2.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Which is easier? — to say to the paralyzed man, ‘Your sins are forgiven’? Or to say ‘Get up, and take up your mat, and walk’?</span></span>
<span class="verse Mark_2_10" data-osis="Mark.2.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">But so you may know that the Son of Man has power to forgive sins on earth”</span>— here he said to the paralyzed man —</span>
<span class="verse Mark_2_11" data-osis="Mark.2.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">“To you I say, Get up, take up your mat, and return to your home.”</span></span>
<span class="verse Mark_2_12" data-osis="Mark.2.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>The man got up, and immediately took up his mat, and went out before them all; at which they were amazed, and, as they praised God, they said: “We have never seen anything like this!”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Mark_2_13" data-osis="Mark.2.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>Jesus went out again to the Sea; and all the people came to him, and he taught them.</span>
<span class="verse Mark_2_14" data-osis="Mark.2.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>As he went along, he saw Levi, the son of Alphaeus, sitting in the tax office, and said to him: <span class="woc">“Follow me.”</span>Levi got up and followed him.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Mark_2_15" data-osis="Mark.2.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>Later on he was in his house having dinner, and a number of tax-gatherers and outcasts took their places at the table with Jesus and his disciples; for many of them were following him.</span>
<span class="verse Mark_2_16" data-osis="Mark.2.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>When the teachers of the law belonging to the party of the Pharisees saw that he was eating in the company of such people, they said to his disciples: “He is eating in the company of tax-gatherers and outcasts!”</span>
<span class="verse Mark_2_17" data-osis="Mark.2.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>Hearing this, Jesus said: <span class="woc">“It is not those who are healthy who need a doctor, but those who are ill. I did not come to call the religious, but the outcast.”</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Mark_2_18" data-osis="Mark.2.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>Now John’s disciples and the Pharisees were fasting, and people came and asked Jesus: “Why is it that John’s disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees fast, while yours do not?”</span>
<span class="verse Mark_2_19" data-osis="Mark.2.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>Jesus answered: <span class="woc">“Can the groom’s friends fast, while the groom is with them? As long as they have the groom with them, they cannot fast.</span></span>
<span class="verse Mark_2_20" data-osis="Mark.2.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">But the days will come, when the groom will be taken away from them, and they will fast then — when that day comes.</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Mark_2_21" data-osis="Mark.2.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">“No one ever sews a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment; if they do, the patch tears away from it — the new from the old — and a worse tear is made.</span></span>
<span class="verse Mark_2_22" data-osis="Mark.2.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">And no one ever puts new wine into old wine-skins; if they do, the wine will burst the skins, and both the wine and the skins are lost. But new wine is put into fresh skins.”</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Mark_2_23" data-osis="Mark.2.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>One Sabbath, as Jesus was walking through the cornfields, his disciples began to pick the ears of wheat as they went along.</span>
<span class="verse Mark_2_24" data-osis="Mark.2.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span>“Look!” the Pharisees said to him, “why are they doing what is not allowed on the Sabbath?”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Mark_2_25" data-osis="Mark.2.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">“Have you never read,”</span>answered Jesus, <span class="woc">“what David did when he was in need and hungry, he and his companions — </span></span>
<span class="verse Mark_2_26" data-osis="Mark.2.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">How he went into the house of God, in the time of Abiathar the high priest, and ate the consecrated bread, which only the priests are allowed to eat, and gave some to his comrades as well?”</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Mark_2_27" data-osis="Mark.2.27"><span class="verse-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span>Then Jesus added: <span class="woc">“The Sabbath was made for people, and not people for the Sabbath;</span></span>
<span class="verse Mark_2_28" data-osis="Mark.2.28"><span class="verse-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">so the Son of Man is lord even of the Sabbath.”</span></span>

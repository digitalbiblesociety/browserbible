<h2 class="chapter-num">3</h2>
<p>
<span class="verse Mark_3_1" data-osis="Mark.3.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>On another occasion Jesus went in to a Synagogue, where there was a man whose hand was withered.</span>
<span class="verse Mark_3_2" data-osis="Mark.3.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>And they watched Jesus closely, to see if he would cure the man on the Sabbath, so that they might have a charge to bring against him.</span>
<span class="verse Mark_3_3" data-osis="Mark.3.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;Stand out in the middle,&rdquo;</span>  Jesus said to the man with the withered hand;</span>
<span class="verse Mark_3_4" data-osis="Mark.3.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>and to the people he said: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Is it allowable to do good on the Sabbath &mdash; or harm? to save a life, or destroy it?&rdquo;</span></span>
<span class="verse Mark_3_5" data-osis="Mark.3.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>As they remained silent, Jesus looked round at them in anger, grieving at the hardness of their hearts, and said to the man: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Stretch out your hand.&rdquo;</span>  The man stretched it out; and his hand had become sound.</span>
<span class="verse Mark_3_6" data-osis="Mark.3.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>Immediately on leaving the Synagogue, the Pharisees and the Herodians united in laying a plot against Jesus, to put him to death.</span>
<span class="verse Mark_3_7" data-osis="Mark.3.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>Then Jesus went away with his disciples to the Sea, followed by a great number of people from Galilee.</span>
<span class="verse Mark_3_8" data-osis="Mark.3.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>And a great number, hearing of all that he was doing, came to him from Judea, from Jerusalem, from Edom, from beyond the Jordan, and from the country round Tyre and Sidon.</span>
<span class="verse Mark_3_9" data-osis="Mark.3.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>So Jesus told his disciples to keep a small boat close by, for fear the crowd should crush him.</span>
<span class="verse Mark_3_10" data-osis="Mark.3.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>For he had cured many of them, and so people kept crowding upon him, that all who were afflicted might touch him.</span>
<span class="verse Mark_3_11" data-osis="Mark.3.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>The foul spirits, too, whenever they caught sight of him, flung themselves down before him, and screamed out: &ldquo;You are the Son of God&rdquo;!</span>
<span class="verse Mark_3_12" data-osis="Mark.3.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>But he repeatedly warned them not to make him known.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Mark_3_13" data-osis="Mark.3.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>And Jesus made his way up the hill, and called those whom he wished; and they went to him.</span>
<span class="verse Mark_3_14" data-osis="Mark.3.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>And he appointed twelve &mdash; whom he also named &lsquo;Apostles&rsquo; &mdash; that they might be with him, and that he might send them out as his Messengers, to preach,</span>
<span class="verse Mark_3_15" data-osis="Mark.3.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>and with power to drive out demons.</span>
<span class="verse Mark_3_16" data-osis="Mark.3.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>So he appointed the Twelve &mdash; Peter (which was the name that Jesus gave to Simon),</span>
<span class="verse Mark_3_17" data-osis="Mark.3.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>James, the son of Zebediah, and his brother John (to whom he gave the name of Boanerges, which means the Thunderers),</span>
<span class="verse Mark_3_18" data-osis="Mark.3.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Zealot,</span>
<span class="verse Mark_3_19" data-osis="Mark.3.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>and Judas Iscariot, the man that betrayed him.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Mark_3_20" data-osis="Mark.3.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>Jesus went into a house; and again a crowd collected, so that they were not able even to eat their food.</span>
<span class="verse Mark_3_21" data-osis="Mark.3.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>When his relations heard of it, they went to take charge of him, for they said that he was out of his mind.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Mark_3_22" data-osis="Mark.3.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>And the Teachers of the Law, who had come down from Jerusalem, said: &ldquo;He has Baal-zebub in him, and he drives the demons out by the help of Baal-zebub, their chief.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Mark_3_23" data-osis="Mark.3.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>So Jesus called them to him, and answered them in parables: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;How can Satan drive out Satan?</span></span>
<span class="verse Mark_3_24" data-osis="Mark.3.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> When a kingdom is divided against itself, it cannot last;</span></span>
<span class="verse Mark_3_25" data-osis="Mark.3.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> and when a household is divided against itself, it will not be able to last.</span></span>
<span class="verse Mark_3_26" data-osis="Mark.3.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> So, if Satan is in revolt against himself and is divided, he cannot last &mdash; his end has come!</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Mark_3_27" data-osis="Mark.3.27"><span class="verse-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;No man who has got into a strong man&rsquo;s house can carry off his goods, without first securing him; and not till then will he plunder his house.</span></span>
<span class="verse Mark_3_28" data-osis="Mark.3.28"><span class="verse-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> I tell you that men will be forgiven everything &mdash; their sins, and all the slanders that they utter;</span></span>
<span class="verse Mark_3_29" data-osis="Mark.3.29"><span class="verse-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> but whoever slanders the Holy Spirit remains unforgiven to the end; he has to answer for an enduring sin.&rdquo;</span></span>
<span class="verse Mark_3_30" data-osis="Mark.3.30"><span class="verse-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span>This was said in reply to the charge that he had a foul spirit in him.</span>
<span class="verse Mark_3_31" data-osis="Mark.3.31"><span class="verse-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span>And his mother and his brothers came, and stood outside, and sent to ask him to come to them.</span>
<span class="verse Mark_3_32" data-osis="Mark.3.32"><span class="verse-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span>There was a crowd sitting round Jesus, and some of them said to him: &ldquo;Look, your mother and your brothers are outside, asking for you.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Mark_3_33" data-osis="Mark.3.33"><span class="verse-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;Who is my mother? and my brothers?&rdquo;</span>  was his reply.</span>
<span class="verse Mark_3_34" data-osis="Mark.3.34"><span class="verse-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span>Then he looked around on the people sitting in a circle round him, and said: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Here are my mother and my brothers!</span></span>
<span class="verse Mark_3_35" data-osis="Mark.3.35"><span class="verse-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Whoever does the will of God is my brother and sister and mother.&rdquo;</span></span>

<p>
<span class="verse Mark_5_1" data-osis="Mark.5.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>They came to the other side of the Sea — the country of the Gerasenes;</span>
<span class="verse Mark_5_2" data-osis="Mark.5.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>and, as soon as Jesus had got out of the boat, he met a man coming out of the tombs, who was under the power of a foul spirit,</span>
<span class="verse Mark_5_3" data-osis="Mark.5.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>and who made his home in the tombs. No one had ever been able to secure him, even with a chain;</span>
<span class="verse Mark_5_4" data-osis="Mark.5.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>for, though he had many times been left secured with fetters and chains, he had snapped the chains and broken the fetters to pieces, and no one could master him.</span>
<span class="verse Mark_5_5" data-osis="Mark.5.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>Night and day alike, he was continually shrieking in the tombs and among the hills, and cutting himself with stones.</span>
<span class="verse Mark_5_6" data-osis="Mark.5.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>Catching sight of Jesus from a distance, he ran and bowed to the ground before him,</span>
<span class="verse Mark_5_7" data-osis="Mark.5.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>shrieking out in a loud voice: “What do you want with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? For God’s sake do not torment me!”</span>
<span class="verse Mark_5_8" data-osis="Mark.5.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>For Jesus had said: <span class="woc">“Come out from the man, you foul spirit.”</span></span>
<span class="verse Mark_5_9" data-osis="Mark.5.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>And he asked him: <span class="woc">“What is your name?”</span>“My name,” he said, “is Legion, for there are many of us;”</span>
<span class="verse Mark_5_10" data-osis="Mark.5.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>and he begged Jesus again and again not to send them away out of that country.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Mark_5_11" data-osis="Mark.5.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>There was a large drove of pigs close by, feeding on the hillside;</span>
<span class="verse Mark_5_12" data-osis="Mark.5.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>and the spirits begged Jesus: “Send us into the pigs so that we can take possession of them.”</span>
<span class="verse Mark_5_13" data-osis="Mark.5.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>Jesus gave them leave. They came out, and entered into the pigs; and the drove — about two thousand in number — rushed down the steep slope into the Sea and were drowned in the Sea.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Mark_5_14" data-osis="Mark.5.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>Then the men who tended them ran away, and carried the news to the town, and to the country around; and the people went to see what had happened.</span>
<span class="verse Mark_5_15" data-osis="Mark.5.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>When they came to Jesus, they found the possessed man sitting there, clothed and in his right mind — the  man who had had the ‘Legion’ in him — and they were awe-struck.</span>
<span class="verse Mark_5_16" data-osis="Mark.5.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>Then those who had seen it related to them all that had happened to the possessed man, as well as about the pigs;</span>
<span class="verse Mark_5_17" data-osis="Mark.5.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>so they began to beg Jesus to leave their neighborhood.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Mark_5_18" data-osis="Mark.5.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>As Jesus was getting into the boat, the possessed man begged him to let him stay with him.</span>
<span class="verse Mark_5_19" data-osis="Mark.5.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>But Jesus refused. <span class="woc">“Go back to your home, to your own people,”</span>he said, <span class="woc">“and tell them of all that the Lord has done for you, and how he took pity on you.”</span></span>
<span class="verse Mark_5_20" data-osis="Mark.5.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>So the man went, and began to proclaim in the district of the Ten Towns all that Jesus had done for him; and everyone was amazed.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Mark_5_21" data-osis="Mark.5.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>By the time Jesus had recrossed in the boat to the opposite shore, a great number of people had gathered to meet him, and were standing by the Sea.</span>
<span class="verse Mark_5_22" data-osis="Mark.5.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>One of the Presidents of the synagogue, whose name was Jaeirus, came and, as soon as he saw Jesus, threw himself at his feet with repeated entreaties.</span>
<span class="verse Mark_5_23" data-osis="Mark.5.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>“My little daughter,” he said, “is at the point of death; I beg you to come and place your hands on her so that her life may be spared.”</span>
<span class="verse Mark_5_24" data-osis="Mark.5.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span>So Jesus went with him. A great number of people followed Jesus, and kept pressing around him.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Mark_5_25" data-osis="Mark.5.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span>Meanwhile a woman who for twelve years had suffered from hemorrhage,</span>
<span class="verse Mark_5_26" data-osis="Mark.5.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span>and undergone much at the hands of many doctors, (spending all she had without obtaining any relief, but, on the contrary, growing worse),</span>
<span class="verse Mark_5_27" data-osis="Mark.5.27"><span class="verse-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span>heard about Jesus, came behind in the crowd, and touched his cloak.</span>
<span class="verse Mark_5_28" data-osis="Mark.5.28"><span class="verse-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span>“If I can only touch his clothes,” she said, “I will get well!”</span>
<span class="verse Mark_5_29" data-osis="Mark.5.29"><span class="verse-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span>At once her bleeding stopped, and she felt in herself that she was cured of her complaint.</span>
<span class="verse Mark_5_30" data-osis="Mark.5.30"><span class="verse-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span>Jesus at once became aware of the power that had gone out from him, and, turning around in the crowd, he said: <span class="woc">“Who touched my clothes?”</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Mark_5_31" data-osis="Mark.5.31"><span class="verse-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span>“You see the people pressing around you,” exclaimed his disciples, “and yet you say <span class="woc">‘Who touched me?’”</span></span>
<span class="verse Mark_5_32" data-osis="Mark.5.32"><span class="verse-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span>But Jesus looked about to see who had done it.</span>
<span class="verse Mark_5_33" data-osis="Mark.5.33"><span class="verse-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span>Then the woman, in fear and trembling, knowing what had happened to her, came and threw herself down before him, and told him the whole truth.</span>
<span class="verse Mark_5_34" data-osis="Mark.5.34"><span class="verse-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">“Daughter,”</span>he said, <span class="woc">“your faith has delivered you. Go, and peace be with you; be free from your complaint.”</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Mark_5_35" data-osis="Mark.5.35"><span class="verse-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span>Before he had finished speaking, some people from the house of the synagogue leader came and said: “Your daughter is dead! Why should you trouble the teacher further?”</span>
<span class="verse Mark_5_36" data-osis="Mark.5.36"><span class="verse-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span>But Jesus, overhearing what they were saying, said to the synagogue leader: <span class="woc">“Do not be afraid; only have faith.”</span></span>
<span class="verse Mark_5_37" data-osis="Mark.5.37"><span class="verse-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span>And he allowed no one to accompany him, except Peter, James, and John, the brother of James.</span>
<span class="verse Mark_5_38" data-osis="Mark.5.38"><span class="verse-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span>Presently they reached the leader’s house, where Jesus saw a scene of confusion — people weeping and wailing incessantly.</span>
<span class="verse Mark_5_39" data-osis="Mark.5.39"><span class="verse-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">“Why this confusion and weeping?”</span>he said on entering. <span class="woc">“The little child is not dead; she is asleep.”</span></span>
<span class="verse Mark_5_40" data-osis="Mark.5.40"><span class="verse-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span>They began to laugh at him; but he sent them all out, and then, with the child’s father and mother and his companions, went into the room where she was lying.</span>
<span class="verse Mark_5_41" data-osis="Mark.5.41"><span class="verse-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span>Taking her hand, Jesus said to her: <span class="woc">“Taleitha, koum!”</span>— which means <span class="woc">‘little girl, I am speaking to you — Rise!’</span></span>
<span class="verse Mark_5_42" data-osis="Mark.5.42"><span class="verse-num v-42">42&nbsp;</span>The little girl stood up at once, and began to walk about; for she was twelve years old. And, as soon as they saw it, they were overwhelmed with amazement;</span>
<span class="verse Mark_5_43" data-osis="Mark.5.43"><span class="verse-num v-43">43&nbsp;</span>but Jesus repeatedly cautioned them not to let anyone know of it, and told them to give her something to eat.</span>

<h2 class="chapter-num">7</h2>
<p>
<span class="verse Mark_7_1" data-osis="Mark.7.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>One day the Pharisees and some of the teachers of the law who had come from Jerusalem gathered around Jesus.</span>
<span class="verse Mark_7_2" data-osis="Mark.7.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>They had noticed that some of his disciples ate their food with their hands ‘defiled,’ by which they meant unwashed.</span>
<span class="verse Mark_7_3" data-osis="Mark.7.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>(For the Pharisees, and indeed all strict Jews, will not eat without first scrupulously washing their hands, holding in this to the traditions of their ancestors.</span>
<span class="verse Mark_7_4" data-osis="Mark.7.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>When they come from market, they will not eat without first sprinkling themselves; and there are many other customs which they have inherited and hold to, such as the ceremonial washing of cups, and jugs, and copper pans).</span>
<span class="verse Mark_7_5" data-osis="Mark.7.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>So the Pharisees and the teachers of the law asked Jesus this question — “How is it that your disciples do not follow the traditions of our ancestors, but eat their food with defiled hands?”</span>
<span class="verse Mark_7_6" data-osis="Mark.7.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>His answer was: <span class="woc">“It was well said by Isaiah when he prophesied about you hypocrites in the words — ‘This is a people who honor me with their lips, while their hearts are far removed from me;</span></span>
<span class="verse Mark_7_7" data-osis="Mark.7.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">but vainly do they worship me, For they teach but human precepts.’</span></span>
<span class="verse Mark_7_8" data-osis="Mark.7.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">You neglect God’s commandments and hold to human traditions.</span></span>
<span class="verse Mark_7_9" data-osis="Mark.7.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Wisely do you set aside God’s commandments,”</span>he exclaimed, <span class="woc">“to keep your own traditions!</span></span>
<span class="verse Mark_7_10" data-osis="Mark.7.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">For while Moses said ‘Honor your father and your mother,’ and ‘Let anyone who abuses their father or mother suffer death,’</span></span>
<span class="verse Mark_7_11" data-osis="Mark.7.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">you say ‘If a person says to their father or mother “Whatever of mine might have been of service to you is Korban”’</span>(which means ‘Given to God’) —</span>
<span class="verse Mark_7_12" data-osis="Mark.7.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">why, then you do not allow them to do anything further for their father or mother!</span></span>
<span class="verse Mark_7_13" data-osis="Mark.7.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">In this way you nullify the words of God by your traditions, which you hand down; and you do many similar things.”</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Mark_7_14" data-osis="Mark.7.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>Then Jesus called the people to him again, and said: <span class="woc">“Listen to me, all of you, and mark my words.</span></span>
<span class="verse Mark_7_15" data-osis="Mark.7.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">There is nothing external to a person, which by going into them can ‘defile’ them; but the things that come out of a person are the things that defile them.”</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Mark_7_17" data-osis="Mark.7.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>When Jesus went indoors, away from the crowd, his disciples began questioning him about this saying.</span>
<span class="verse Mark_7_18" data-osis="Mark.7.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">“What, do even you understand so little?”</span>exclaimed Jesus. <span class="woc">“Don’t you see that there is nothing external to a person, which by going into a person, can ‘defile’ them,</span></span>
<span class="verse Mark_7_19" data-osis="Mark.7.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">because it does not pass into his heart, but into his stomach, and is afterwards got rid of? — in saying this Jesus pronounced all food ‘clean.’</span></span>
<span class="verse Mark_7_20" data-osis="Mark.7.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">“It is what comes out from a person,”</span>he added, <span class="woc">“that defiles them,</span></span>
<span class="verse Mark_7_21" data-osis="Mark.7.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">for it is from within, out of the hearts of people, that there come evil thoughts — sexual immorality, theft, murder, adultery,</span></span>
<span class="verse Mark_7_22" data-osis="Mark.7.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">greed, wickedness, deceit, indecency, envy, slander, haughtiness, folly;</span></span>
<span class="verse Mark_7_23" data-osis="Mark.7.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">all these wicked things come from within, and do defile a person.”</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Mark_7_24" data-osis="Mark.7.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span>On leaving that place, Jesus went to the district of Tyre and Sidon. He went into a house, and did not wish anyone to know it, but could not escape notice.</span>
<span class="verse Mark_7_25" data-osis="Mark.7.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span>For a woman, whose little daughter had a foul spirit in her, heard of him immediately, and came and threw herself at his feet —</span>
<span class="verse Mark_7_26" data-osis="Mark.7.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span>the woman was a foreigner, from Syrian Phoenicia — and she begged him to drive the demon out of her daughter.</span>
<span class="verse Mark_7_27" data-osis="Mark.7.27"><span class="verse-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">“Let the children be satisfied first,”</span>answered Jesus. <span class="woc">“For it is not fair to take the children’s food, and throw it to dogs.”</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Mark_7_28" data-osis="Mark.7.28"><span class="verse-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span>“Yes, Master,” she replied; “even the dogs under the table do feed on the children’s crumbs.”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Mark_7_29" data-osis="Mark.7.29"><span class="verse-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">“For saying that,”</span>he answered, <span class="woc">“you may go. The demon has gone out of your daughter.”</span></span>
<span class="verse Mark_7_30" data-osis="Mark.7.30"><span class="verse-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span>The woman went home, and found the child lying on her bed, and the demon gone.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Mark_7_31" data-osis="Mark.7.31"><span class="verse-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span>On returning from the district of Tyre, Jesus went, by way of Sidon, to the Sea of Galilee, across the district of the Ten Towns.</span>
<span class="verse Mark_7_32" data-osis="Mark.7.32"><span class="verse-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span>Some people brought to him a man who was deaf and almost dumb, and they begged Jesus to place his hand on him.</span>
<span class="verse Mark_7_33" data-osis="Mark.7.33"><span class="verse-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span>Jesus took him aside from the crowd quietly, put his fingers into the man’s ears, and touched his tongue with saliva.</span>
<span class="verse Mark_7_34" data-osis="Mark.7.34"><span class="verse-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span>Then, looking up to heaven, he sighed, and said to the man: <span class="woc">“Ephphatha!”</span>which means <span class="woc">‘Be opened.’</span></span>
<span class="verse Mark_7_35" data-osis="Mark.7.35"><span class="verse-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span>The man’s ears were opened, the string of his tongue was freed, and he began to talk plainly.</span>
<span class="verse Mark_7_36" data-osis="Mark.7.36"><span class="verse-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span>Jesus insisted on their not telling anyone; but the more he insisted, the more perseveringly they made it known,</span>
<span class="verse Mark_7_37" data-osis="Mark.7.37"><span class="verse-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span>and a profound impression was made on the people. “He has done everything well!” they exclaimed. “He makes even the deaf hear and the dumb speak!”</span>

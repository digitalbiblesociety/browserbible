<h2 class="chapter-num">8</h2>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.8.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>About that time, when there was again a great crowd of people who had nothing to eat, Jesus called his disciples to him, and said:</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.8.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;My heart is moved at the sight of all these people, for they have already been with me three days and they have nothing to eat;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.8.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> and if I send them away to their homes hungry, they will break down on the way; and some of them have come a long distance.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.8.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Where will it be possible,&rdquo; his disciples answered, &ldquo;to get sufficient bread for these people in this lonely place?&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.8.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;How many loaves have you?&rdquo;</span>  he asked. &ldquo;Seven,&rdquo; they answered.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.8.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>Jesus told the crowd to sit down upon the ground. Then he took the seven loaves, and, after saying the thanksgiving, broke them, and gave them to his disciples to serve out; and they served them out to the crowd.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.8.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>They had also a few small fish; and, after he had said the blessing, he told the disciples to serve out these as well.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.8.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>The people had sufficient to eat, and they picked up seven baskets full of the broken pieces that were left.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.8.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>There were about four thousand people. Then Jesus dismissed them.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.8.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>Immediately afterwards, getting into the boat with his disciples, Jesus went to the district of Dalmanutha.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.8.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>Here the Pharisees came out, and began to argue with Jesus, asking him for some sign from the heavens, to test him.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.8.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>Sighing deeply, Jesus said: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Why does this generation ask for a sign? I tell you, no sign shall be given it.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.8.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>So he left them to themselves, and, getting into the boat again, went away to the opposite shore.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.8.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>Now the disciples had forgotten to take any bread with them, one loaf being all that they had in the boat.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.8.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>So Jesus gave them this warning. <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Take care,&rdquo;</span>  he said, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of Herod.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.8.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span>They began talking to one another about their being short of bread.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.8.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span>And, noticing this, Jesus said to them: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Why are you talking about your being short of bread? Do not you yet see or understand? Are your minds still so slow or comprehension?</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.8.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;Though you have eyes, do you not see? and though you have ears, do you not hear?&rsquo; Do not you remember,</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.8.19"><span class="verse-num">19&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> when I broke up the five loaves for the five thousand, how many baskets of broken pieces you picked up?&rdquo;</span>  &ldquo;Twelve,&rdquo; they said.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.8.20"><span class="verse-num">20&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;And when the seven for the four thousand, how many basketfuls of broken pieces did you pick up?&rdquo;</span>  &ldquo;Seven,&rdquo; they said.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.8.21"><span class="verse-num">21&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;Do not you understand now?&rdquo;</span>  he repeated.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.8.22"><span class="verse-num">22&nbsp;</span>They came to Bethsaida. There some people brought a blind man to Jesus, and begged him to touch him.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.8.23"><span class="verse-num">23&nbsp;</span>Taking the blind man&rsquo;s hand, Jesus led him to the outskirts of the village, and, when he had put saliva on the man&rsquo;s eyes, he placed his hands on him, and asked him: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Do you see anything?&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.8.24"><span class="verse-num">24&nbsp;</span>The man looked up, and said: &ldquo;I see the people, for, as they walk about, they look to me like trees.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.8.25"><span class="verse-num">25&nbsp;</span>Then Jesus again placed his hands on the man&rsquo;s eyes; and the man saw clearly, his sight was restored, and he saw everything with perfect distinctness.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.8.26"><span class="verse-num">26&nbsp;</span>Jesus sent him to his home, and said: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Do not go even into the village.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.8.27"><span class="verse-num">27&nbsp;</span>Afterwards Jesus and his disciples went into the villages round Caesarea Philippi; and on the way he asked his disciples this question &mdash; <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Who do people say that I am?&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.8.28"><span class="verse-num">28&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;John the Baptist,&rdquo; they answered, &ldquo;but others say Elijah, while others say one of the Prophets.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.8.29"><span class="verse-num">29&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;But you,&rdquo;</span>  he asked, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;who do you say that I am?&rdquo;</span>  To this Peter replied: &ldquo;You are the Christ.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.8.30"><span class="verse-num">30&nbsp;</span>On which Jesus charged them not to say this about him to anyone.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.8.31"><span class="verse-num">31&nbsp;</span>Then he began to teach them that the Son of Man must undergo much suffering, and that he must be rejected by the Councillors, and the Chief Priests, and the Teachers of the Law, and be put to death, and rise again after three days.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.8.32"><span class="verse-num">32&nbsp;</span>This statement he made openly. But Peter took Jesus aside, and began to rebuke him.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.8.33"><span class="verse-num">33&nbsp;</span>Jesus, however, turning round and seeing his disciples, rebuked Peter. <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Out of my sight, Satan!&rdquo;</span>  he exclaimed. <span class="woc"> &ldquo;For you look at things, not as God does, but as man does.&rdquo;</span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.8.34"><span class="verse-num">34&nbsp;</span>Calling the people and his disciples to him, Jesus said: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;If any man wishes to walk in my steps, let him renounce self, take up his cross, and follow me.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.8.35"><span class="verse-num">35&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> For whoever wishes to save his life will lose it, and whoever, for my sake and for the sake of the Good News, will lose his life shall save it.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.8.36"><span class="verse-num">36&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> What good is it to a man to gain the whole world and forfeit his life?</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.8.37"><span class="verse-num">37&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> For what could a man give that is of equal value with his life?</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.8.38"><span class="verse-num">38&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Whoever is ashamed of me and of my teaching, in this unfaithful and wicked generation, of him will the Son of Man be ashamed, when he comes in his Father&rsquo;s Glory with the holy angels.&rdquo;</span></span>

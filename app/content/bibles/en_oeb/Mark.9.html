<p>
<span class="verse Mark_9_1" data-osis="Mark.9.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">“I tell you,”</span>he added, <span class="woc">“that some of those who are standing here will not know death until they have seen the kingdom of God come in power.”</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Mark_9_2" data-osis="Mark.9.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>Six days later, Jesus took with him Peter, James, and John, and led them up a high mountain alone by themselves. There his appearance was transformed before their eyes,</span>
<span class="verse Mark_9_3" data-osis="Mark.9.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>and his clothes became of a more dazzling white than any bleacher in the world could make them.</span>
<span class="verse Mark_9_4" data-osis="Mark.9.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>And Elijah appeared to them, in company with Moses; and they were talking with Jesus.</span>
<span class="verse Mark_9_5" data-osis="Mark.9.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>“Rabbi,” said Peter, interposing, “it is good to be here; let us make three tents, one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.”</span>
<span class="verse Mark_9_6" data-osis="Mark.9.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>For he did not know what to say, because they were much afraid.</span>
<span class="verse Mark_9_7" data-osis="Mark.9.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>Then a cloud came down and enveloped them; and from the cloud there came a voice — “This is my dearly loved son; listen to him.”</span>
<span class="verse Mark_9_8" data-osis="Mark.9.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>And suddenly, on looking around, they saw that there was now no one with them but Jesus alone.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Mark_9_9" data-osis="Mark.9.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>As they were going down the mountainside, Jesus cautioned them not to relate what they had seen to anyone, until after the Son of Man should have risen again from the dead.</span>
<span class="verse Mark_9_10" data-osis="Mark.9.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>They seized on these words and discussed with one another what this ‘rising from the dead’ meant.</span>
<span class="verse Mark_9_11" data-osis="Mark.9.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>“How is it,” they asked Jesus, “that our teachers of the law say that Elijah has to come first?”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Mark_9_12" data-osis="Mark.9.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">“Elijah does indeed come first,”</span>answered Jesus, <span class="woc">“and re-establish everything; and does not scripture speak, with regard to the Son of Man, of his undergoing much suffering and being utterly despised?</span></span>
<span class="verse Mark_9_13" data-osis="Mark.9.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">But I tell you that Elijah has come, and people have treated him just as they pleased, as scripture says of him.”</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Mark_9_14" data-osis="Mark.9.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>When they came to the other disciples, they saw a great crowd around them, and some teachers of the law arguing with them.</span>
<span class="verse Mark_9_15" data-osis="Mark.9.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>But, as soon as they saw Jesus, all the people, in great astonishment, ran up and greeted him.</span>
<span class="verse Mark_9_16" data-osis="Mark.9.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">“What are you arguing about with them?”</span>Jesus asked.</span>
<span class="verse Mark_9_17" data-osis="Mark.9.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>“Teacher,” answered a man in the crowd, “I brought my son to see you, as he has a dumb spirit in him;</span>
<span class="verse Mark_9_18" data-osis="Mark.9.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>and, wherever it seizes him, it dashes him down; he foams at the mouth and grinds his teeth, and he is pining away. I asked your disciples to drive the spirit out, but they failed.”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Mark_9_19" data-osis="Mark.9.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">“Faithless generation!”</span>exclaimed Jesus. <span class="woc">“How long must I be with you? How long must I have patience with you? Bring the boy to me.”</span></span>
<span class="verse Mark_9_20" data-osis="Mark.9.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>They brought him to Jesus; but no sooner did the boy see him than the spirit threw him into convulsions; and he fell on the ground, and rolled about, foaming at the mouth.</span>
<span class="verse Mark_9_21" data-osis="Mark.9.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">“How long has he been like this?”</span>Jesus asked the boy’s father.</span>
<span class="verse Mark_9_22" data-osis="Mark.9.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>“From his childhood,” he answered; “and it has often thrown him into fire and into water to put an end to his life; but, if you can possibly do anything, take pity on us, and help us!”</span>
<span class="verse Mark_9_23" data-osis="Mark.9.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Why say ‘possibly’?”</span>Jesus replied. <span class="woc">“Everything is possible for one who has faith.”</span></span>
<span class="verse Mark_9_24" data-osis="Mark.9.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span>The boy’s father immediately cried out: “I have faith; help my want of faith!”</span>
<span class="verse Mark_9_25" data-osis="Mark.9.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span>But, when Jesus saw that a crowd was quickly collecting, he rebuked the foul spirit: <span class="woc">“Deaf and dumb spirit, it is I who command you. Come out from him and never enter him again.”</span></span>
<span class="verse Mark_9_26" data-osis="Mark.9.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span>With a loud cry the spirit threw the boy into repeated convulsions, and then came out from him. The boy looked like a corpse, so that most of them said that he was dead.</span>
<span class="verse Mark_9_27" data-osis="Mark.9.27"><span class="verse-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span>But Jesus took his hand, and lifted him; and he stood up.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Mark_9_28" data-osis="Mark.9.28"><span class="verse-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span>When Jesus had gone indoors, his disciples asked him privately: “Why could not we drive it out?”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Mark_9_29" data-osis="Mark.9.29"><span class="verse-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">“A spirit of this kind,”</span>he said, <span class="woc">“can be driven out only by prayer.”</span></span>
<span class="verse Mark_9_30" data-osis="Mark.9.30"><span class="verse-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span>Leaving that place, Jesus and his disciples went on their way through Galilee; but he did not wish anyone to know it,</span>
<span class="verse Mark_9_31" data-osis="Mark.9.31"><span class="verse-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span>for he was instructing his disciples, and telling them — <span class="woc">“The Son of Man is being betrayed into the hands of his fellow men, and they will put him to death, but, when he has been put to death, he will rise again after three days.”</span></span>
<span class="verse Mark_9_32" data-osis="Mark.9.32"><span class="verse-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span>But the disciples did not understand his meaning and were afraid to question him.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Mark_9_33" data-osis="Mark.9.33"><span class="verse-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span>They came to Capernaum. When Jesus had gone into the house, he asked them: <span class="woc">“What were you discussing on the way?”</span></span>
<span class="verse Mark_9_34" data-osis="Mark.9.34"><span class="verse-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span>But they were silent; for on the way they had been arguing with one another which was the greatest.</span>
<span class="verse Mark_9_35" data-osis="Mark.9.35"><span class="verse-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span>Sitting down, Jesus called the Twelve and said: <span class="woc">“If anyone wishes to be first, he must be last of all, and servant of all.”</span></span>
<span class="verse Mark_9_36" data-osis="Mark.9.36"><span class="verse-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span>Then Jesus took a little child, and placed it in the middle of them. Folding it in his arms, he said to them:</span>
<span class="verse Mark_9_37" data-osis="Mark.9.37"><span class="verse-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">“Anyone who, for the sake of my name, welcomes even a little child like this is welcoming me, and anyone who welcomes me is welcoming not me, but him who sent me as his messenger.”</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Mark_9_38" data-osis="Mark.9.38"><span class="verse-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span>“Teacher,” said John, “we saw a man driving out demons by using your name, and we tried to prevent him, because he did not follow us.”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Mark_9_39" data-osis="Mark.9.39"><span class="verse-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">“None of you must prevent the man,”</span>answered Jesus, <span class="woc">“for no one will use my name in working a miracle, and yet find it easy to speak evil of me.</span></span>
<span class="verse Mark_9_40" data-osis="Mark.9.40"><span class="verse-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">He who is not against us is for us.</span></span>
<span class="verse Mark_9_41" data-osis="Mark.9.41"><span class="verse-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">If anyone gives you a cup of water because you belong to Christ, I tell you, he will assuredly not lose his reward.</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Mark_9_42" data-osis="Mark.9.42"><span class="verse-num v-42">42&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">‘And, if anyone puts temptation in the way of one of these little ones who believe in me, it would be far better for him if he had been thrown into the sea with a great millstone around his neck.</span></span>
<span class="verse Mark_9_43" data-osis="Mark.9.43"><span class="verse-num v-43">43&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">If your hand causes you to sin, cut it off. It would be better for you to enter the life maimed, than to have both your hands and go into Gehenna, into the fire that cannot be put out.</span></span>
<span class="verse Mark_9_45" data-osis="Mark.9.45"><span class="verse-num v-45">45&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">If your foot causes you to sin, cut it off. It would be better for you to enter the life lame, than to have both your feet and be thrown into Gehenna.</span></span>
<span class="verse Mark_9_47" data-osis="Mark.9.47"><span class="verse-num v-47">47&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">If your eye causes you to sin, tear it out. It would be better for you to enter the kingdom of God with only one eye, than to have both eyes and be thrown into Gehenna,</span></span>
<span class="verse Mark_9_48" data-osis="Mark.9.48"><span class="verse-num v-48">48&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">where ‘their worm does not die, and the fire is not put out.’</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Mark_9_49" data-osis="Mark.9.49"><span class="verse-num v-49">49&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">‘For it is by fire that everyone will be salted.</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Mark_9_50" data-osis="Mark.9.50"><span class="verse-num v-50">50&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">‘Salt is good, but, if the salt should lose its saltiness, what will you use to season it? </span></span>
</p>
<p><span class="woc">‘You must have salt in yourselves, and live at peace with one another.”</span>

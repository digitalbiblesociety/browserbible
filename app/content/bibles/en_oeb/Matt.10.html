<span class="verse Matt_10_6" data-osis="Matt.10.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">but make your way rather to the lost sheep of Israel.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_10_7" data-osis="Matt.10.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">On your way proclaim that the kingdom of heaven is at hand.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_10_8" data-osis="Matt.10.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Cure the sick, raise the dead, make the lepers clean, drive out demons. You have received free of cost, give free of cost.</span></span>

<span class="verse Matt_10_11" data-osis="Matt.10.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Whatever town or village you visit, find out who is worthy in that place, and remain there until you leave.</span></span>

<span class="verse Matt_10_13" data-osis="Matt.10.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Then, if the house is worthy, let your blessing rest on it, but, if it is unworthy, let your blessing return on yourselves.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_10_14" data-osis="Matt.10.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">If no one welcomes you, or listens to what you say, as you leave that house or that town, shake off its dust from your feet.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_10_15" data-osis="Matt.10.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">I tell you, the doom of the land of Sodom and Gomorrah will be more bearable in the ‘day of judgment’ than the doom of that town.</span></span>

<p>
<span class="verse Matt_10_16" data-osis="Matt.10.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Remember, I am sending you out as my messengers like sheep among wolves. So be as wise as snakes, and as blameless as doves.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_10_17" data-osis="Matt.10.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Be on your guard against others, for they will betray you to courts of law, and scourge you in their Synagogues;</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_10_18" data-osis="Matt.10.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">and you will be brought before governors and kings for my sake so that you may witness for me before them and the nations.</span></span>

<span class="verse Matt_10_20" data-osis="Matt.10.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">for it will not be you who speak, but the Spirit of your Father that speaks within you.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_10_21" data-osis="Matt.10.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Brother will betray brother to death, and the father his child; and children will turn against their parents, and cause them to be put to death;</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_10_22" data-osis="Matt.10.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">and you will be hated by everyone because of me. Yet the person who endures to the end will be saved.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_10_23" data-osis="Matt.10.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">But, when they persecute you in one town, escape to the next; for, I tell you, you will not have come to the end of the towns of Israel before the Son of Man comes.</span></span>

<span class="verse Matt_10_25" data-osis="Matt.10.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">It is enough for a scholar to be treated like his teacher, and a servant like his master.

<span class="verse Matt_10_26" data-osis="Matt.10.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Do not, therefore, be afraid of them. There is nothing concealed which will not be revealed, nor anything hidden which will not become known.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_10_27" data-osis="Matt.10.27"><span class="verse-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">What I tell you in the dark, say again in the light; and what is whispered in your ear, proclaim on the housetops.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_10_28" data-osis="Matt.10.28"><span class="verse-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Do not be afraid of those who kill the body, but are unable to kill the soul; rather be afraid of him who is able to destroy both soul and body in Gehenna.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_10_29" data-osis="Matt.10.29"><span class="verse-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Are not two sparrows sold for a one copper coin? Yet not one of them will fall to the ground without your Father’s knowledge.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_10_30" data-osis="Matt.10.30"><span class="verse-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">While as for you, even the hairs of your head are numbered.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_10_31" data-osis="Matt.10.31"><span class="verse-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Do not, therefore, be afraid; you are of more value than many sparrows.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_10_32" data-osis="Matt.10.32"><span class="verse-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Everyone, therefore, who will publicly acknowledge me, I, too, will acknowledge before my Father who is in heaven;</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_10_33" data-osis="Matt.10.33"><span class="verse-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">but, if anyone publicly disowns me, I, too, will disown him before my Father who is in heaven.</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Matt_10_34" data-osis="Matt.10.34"><span class="verse-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Do not imagine that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I have come to bring, not peace, but the sword.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_10_35" data-osis="Matt.10.35"><span class="verse-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">For I have come to set — ‘a man against his father, and a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_10_36" data-osis="Matt.10.36"><span class="verse-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">A person’s enemies will be the members of their own household.’</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_10_37" data-osis="Matt.10.37"><span class="verse-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Anyone who loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me; and anyone who loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_10_38" data-osis="Matt.10.38"><span class="verse-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Anyone who does not take their cross and follow in my steps is not worthy of me.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_10_39" data-osis="Matt.10.39"><span class="verse-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">The person who has found their life will lose it, while the person who, for my sake, has lost their life will find it.</span></span>

<p>
<span class="verse Matt_10_40" data-osis="Matt.10.40"><span class="verse-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Anyone who welcomes you is welcoming me; and anyone who welcomes me is welcoming him who sent me as his messenger.</span></span>

<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.11.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>After Jesus had finished giving directions to his twelve Disciples, he left that place in order to teach and preach in their towns.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.11.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>Now John had heard in prison what the Christ was doing, and he sent a message by his disciples,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.11.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>and asked &mdash; &rdquo; Are you &lsquo;The Coming One,&rsquo; or are we to look for someone else?&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.11.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>The answer of Jesus to the question was &mdash; <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Go and report to John what you hear and see &mdash; </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.11.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> the blind recover their sight and the lame walk, the lepers are made clean and the deaf hear, the dead, too, are raised to life, and the good news is told to the poor.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.11.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> And blessed is the man who finds no hindrance in me.&rdquo; </span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.11.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>While these men were going back, Jesus began to say to the crowds with reference to John:</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.11.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;What did you go out into the Wilderness to look at? A reed waving in the wind? If not, what did you go out to see? A man richly dressed? Why, those who wear rich things are to be found in the courts of kings!</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.11.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> What, then, did you go for? To see a Prophet? Yes, I tell you, and far more than a Prophet.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.11.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> This is the man of whom Scripture says &mdash; &lsquo;Behold, I am myself sending my Messenger before thy face, and he shall prepare thy way before thee.&rsquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.11.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> I tell you, no one born of a woman has yet appeared who is greater than John the Baptist; and yet the lowliest in the Kingdom of Heaven is greater than he.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.11.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> From the time of John the Baptist to this very hour, the Kingdom of Heaven has been taken by force, and men using force have been seizing it.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.11.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> For the teaching of all the Prophets and of the Law continued till the time of John;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.11.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> and &mdash; if you are ready to accept it &mdash; John is himself the Elijah who was destined to come.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.11.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Let him who has ears hear.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.11.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> But to what shall I compare the present generation? It is like little children sitting in the market-places and calling out to their playmates &mdash; </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.11.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &lsquo;We have played the flute for you, but you have not danced; We have wailed, but you have not mourned.&rsquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.11.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> For, when John came, neither eating nor drinking, men said &lsquo;He has a demon in him&rsquo;;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.11.19"><span class="verse-num">19&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> and now that the Son of Man has come, eating and drinking, they are saying &lsquo;Here is a glutton and a wine-drinker, a friend of tax-gatherers and outcasts!&rsquo; And yet Wisdom is vindicated by her actions.&rdquo; </span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.11.20"><span class="verse-num">20&nbsp;</span>Then Jesus began to reproach the towns in which most of his miracles had been done, because they had not repented:</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.11.21"><span class="verse-num">21&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;Alas for you, Chorazin! Alas for you, Bethsaida! For, if the miracles which were done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.11.22"><span class="verse-num">22&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Yet, I tell you, the doom of Tyre and Sidon will be more bearable in the &lsquo;Day of Judgment&rsquo; than yours.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.11.23"><span class="verse-num">23&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> And you, Capernaum! Will you &lsquo;exalt yourself to Heaven&rsquo;? &lsquo;You shall go down to the Place of Death.&rsquo; For, if the miracles which have been done in you had been done in Sodom, it would have been standing to this day.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.11.24"><span class="verse-num">24&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Yet, I tell you, the doom of Sodom will be more bearable in the &lsquo;Day of Judgment&rsquo; than yours.&rdquo; </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.11.25"><span class="verse-num">25&nbsp;</span>At that same time Jesus uttered the words: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;I thank thee, Father, Lord of Heaven and earth, that, though thou has hidden these things from the wise and learned, thou hast revealed them to the child-like!</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.11.26"><span class="verse-num">26&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Yes, Father, I thank thee that this has seemed good to thee.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.11.27"><span class="verse-num">27&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Everything has been committed to me by my Father; nor does any one fully know the Son, except the Father, or fully know the Father, except the Son and those to whom the Son may choose to reveal him.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.11.28"><span class="verse-num">28&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Come to me, all you who toil and are burdened, and I will give you rest!</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.11.29"><span class="verse-num">29&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me, for I am gentle and lowly-minded, and &lsquo;you shall find rest for your souls&rsquo;;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.11.30"><span class="verse-num">30&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> for my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.&rdquo; </span></span>

<p>
<span class="verse Matt_11_1" data-osis="Matt.11.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>After Jesus had finished giving directions to his twelve Disciples, he left that place in order to teach and preach in their towns.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Matt_11_2" data-osis="Matt.11.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>Now John had heard in prison what the Christ was doing, and he sent a message by his disciples,</span>
<span class="verse Matt_11_3" data-osis="Matt.11.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>and asked — ” Are you ‘the coming one,’ or are we to look for someone else?”</span>
<span class="verse Matt_11_4" data-osis="Matt.11.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>The answer of Jesus to the question was — <span class="woc">“Go and report to John what you hear and see — </span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_11_5" data-osis="Matt.11.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">the blind recover their sight and the lame walk, the lepers are made clean and the deaf hear, the dead, too, are raised to life, and the good news is told to the poor.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_11_6" data-osis="Matt.11.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Blessed is the person who finds no hindrance in me.” </span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Matt_11_7" data-osis="Matt.11.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>While John’s disciples were going back, Jesus began to say to the crowds with reference to John:</span>
<span class="verse Matt_11_8" data-osis="Matt.11.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">“What did you go out into the wilderness to look at? A reed waving in the wind? If not, what did you go out to see? A man richly dressed? Why, those who wear rich things are to be found in the courts of kings!</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_11_9" data-osis="Matt.11.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">What, then, did you go for? To see a prophet? Yes, I tell you, and far more than a prophet.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_11_10" data-osis="Matt.11.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">This is the man of whom scripture says — ‘I am sending my messenger ahead of you, and he will prepare your way before you.’</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_11_11" data-osis="Matt.11.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">I tell you, no one born of a woman has yet appeared who is greater than John the Baptist; and yet the least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_11_12" data-osis="Matt.11.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">From the time of John the Baptist to this very hour, the kingdom of heaven has been taken by force, and people using force have been seizing it.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_11_13" data-osis="Matt.11.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">For the teaching of all the prophets and of the law continued until the time of John;</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_11_14" data-osis="Matt.11.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">and — if you are ready to accept it — John is himself the Elijah who was destined to come.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_11_15" data-osis="Matt.11.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Let him who has ears hear.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_11_16" data-osis="Matt.11.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">But to what will I compare the present generation? It is like little children sitting in the market-places and calling out to their playmates — </span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_11_17" data-osis="Matt.11.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">‘We have played the flute for you, but you have not danced; We have wailed, but you have not mourned.’</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_11_18" data-osis="Matt.11.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">For, when John came, neither eating nor drinking, people said ‘He has a demon in him’;</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_11_19" data-osis="Matt.11.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">and now that the Son of Man has come, eating and drinking, they are saying ‘Here is a glutton and a wine-drinker, a friend of tax-gatherers and outcasts!’ And yet wisdom is vindicated by her actions.” </span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Matt_11_20" data-osis="Matt.11.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>Then Jesus began to reproach the towns in which most of his miracles had been done, because they had not repented:</span>
<span class="verse Matt_11_21" data-osis="Matt.11.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">“Alas for you, Chorazin! Alas for you, Bethsaida! For, if the miracles which were done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_11_22" data-osis="Matt.11.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Yet, I tell you, the doom of Tyre and Sidon will be more bearable in the ‘day of judgment’ than yours.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_11_23" data-osis="Matt.11.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">And you, Capernaum! Will you ‘exalt yourself to heaven’? ‘You will go down to the place of death.’ For, if the miracles which have been done in you had been done in Sodom, it would have been standing to this day.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_11_24" data-osis="Matt.11.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Yet, I tell you, the doom of Sodom will be more bearable in the ‘day of judgment’ than yours.” </span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_11_25" data-osis="Matt.11.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span>At that same time Jesus uttered the words: <span class="woc">“I thank you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that, though you have hidden these things from the wise and learned, you have revealed them to the child-like!</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_11_26" data-osis="Matt.11.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Yes, Father, I thank you that this has seemed good to you.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_11_27" data-osis="Matt.11.27"><span class="verse-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Everything has been committed to me by my Father; nor does anyone fully know the Son, except the Father, or fully know the Father, except the Son and those to whom the Son may choose to reveal him.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_11_28" data-osis="Matt.11.28"><span class="verse-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Come to me, all you who toil and are burdened, and I will give you rest!</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_11_29" data-osis="Matt.11.29"><span class="verse-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Take my yoke on you, and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble, and ‘you will find rest for your souls’;</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_11_30" data-osis="Matt.11.30"><span class="verse-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">for my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.” </span></span>

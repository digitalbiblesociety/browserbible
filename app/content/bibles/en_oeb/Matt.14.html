<h2 class="chapter-num">14</h2>
<p>
<span class="verse Matt_14_1" data-osis="Matt.14.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>At that time Prince Herod heard of the fame of Jesus,</span>
<span class="verse Matt_14_2" data-osis="Matt.14.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>and said to his attendants: “This must be John the Baptist; he must be risen from the dead, and that is why these miraculous powers are active in him.”</span>
<span class="verse Matt_14_3" data-osis="Matt.14.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>For Herod had arrested John, put him in chains, and shut him up in prison, to please Herodias, the wife of Herod’s brother Philip.</span>
<span class="verse Matt_14_4" data-osis="Matt.14.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>For John had said to him ‘You have no right to be living with her.’</span>
<span class="verse Matt_14_5" data-osis="Matt.14.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>Yet, though Herod wanted to put him to death, he was afraid of the people, because they looked on John as a prophet.</span>
<span class="verse Matt_14_6" data-osis="Matt.14.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>But, when Herod’s birthday came, the daughter of Herodias danced before his guests, and so pleased Herod,</span>
<span class="verse Matt_14_7" data-osis="Matt.14.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>that he promised with an oath to give her whatever she asked.</span>
<span class="verse Matt_14_8" data-osis="Matt.14.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>Prompted by her mother, the girl said ‘Give me here, on a dish, the head of John the Baptist.’</span>
<span class="verse Matt_14_9" data-osis="Matt.14.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>The king was distressed at this; yet, because of his oath and of the guests at his table, he ordered it to be given her.</span>
<span class="verse Matt_14_10" data-osis="Matt.14.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>He sent and beheaded John in the prison;</span>
<span class="verse Matt_14_11" data-osis="Matt.14.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>and his head was brought on a dish and given to the girl, and she took it to her mother.</span>
<span class="verse Matt_14_12" data-osis="Matt.14.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>Then John’s disciples came, and took the body away, and buried it; and went and told Jesus.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Matt_14_13" data-osis="Matt.14.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>When Jesus heard of it, he left privately in a boat to a lonely spot. The people, however, heard of his going, and followed him in crowds from the towns on foot.</span>
<span class="verse Matt_14_14" data-osis="Matt.14.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>On getting out of the boat, Jesus saw a great crowd, and his heart was moved at the sight of them; and he cured all the sick among them.</span>
<span class="verse Matt_14_15" data-osis="Matt.14.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>In the evening the disciples came up to him, and said: “This is a lonely spot, and the day is now far advanced; send the crowds away so that they can to the villages, and buy themselves food.”</span>
<span class="verse Matt_14_16" data-osis="Matt.14.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>But Jesus said: <span class="woc">“They need not go away, it is for you to give them something to eat.” </span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_14_17" data-osis="Matt.14.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>“We have nothing here,” they said, “except five loaves and two fishes.”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Matt_14_18" data-osis="Matt.14.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">“Bring them here to me,” </span>was his reply.</span>
<span class="verse Matt_14_19" data-osis="Matt.14.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>Jesus ordered the people to take their seats on the grass; and, taking the five loaves and the two fishes, he looked up to heaven, and said the blessing, and, after he had broken the loaves, gave them to his disciples; and they gave them to the crowds.</span>
<span class="verse Matt_14_20" data-osis="Matt.14.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>Everyone had sufficient to eat, and they picked up enough of the broken pieces that were left to fill twelve baskets.</span>
<span class="verse Matt_14_21" data-osis="Matt.14.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>The men who ate were about five thousand in number, without counting women and children.</span>
<span class="verse Matt_14_22" data-osis="Matt.14.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>Immediately afterwards Jesus made the disciples get into a boat and cross over in advance of him, while he dismissed the crowds.</span>
<span class="verse Matt_14_23" data-osis="Matt.14.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>After dismissing the crowds, he went up the hill by himself to pray; and, when evening fell, he was there alone.</span>
<span class="verse Matt_14_24" data-osis="Matt.14.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span>The boat was by this time some miles from shore, laboring in the waves, for the wind was against her.</span>
<span class="verse Matt_14_25" data-osis="Matt.14.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span>Three hours after midnight, however, Jesus came towards the disciples, walking on the water.</span>
<span class="verse Matt_14_26" data-osis="Matt.14.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span>But, when they saw him walking on the water, they were terrified. “It is a ghost,” they exclaimed, and cried out in fear.</span>
<span class="verse Matt_14_27" data-osis="Matt.14.27"><span class="verse-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span>But Jesus at once spoke to them. <span class="woc">“Courage!” </span>he said, <span class="woc">“It is I; do not be afraid!” </span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_14_28" data-osis="Matt.14.28"><span class="verse-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span>“Master,” Peter exclaimed, “if it is you, tell me to come to you on the water.”</span>
<span class="verse Matt_14_29" data-osis="Matt.14.29"><span class="verse-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span>Jesus said: <span class="woc">“Come.” </span>So Peter got down from the boat, and walked on the water, and went towards Jesus;</span>
<span class="verse Matt_14_30" data-osis="Matt.14.30"><span class="verse-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span>but, when he felt the wind, he was frightened, and, beginning to sink, cried out: “Master! Save me!”</span>
<span class="verse Matt_14_31" data-osis="Matt.14.31"><span class="verse-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span>Instantly Jesus stretched out his hand, and caught hold of him. <span class="woc">“You of little faith!” </span>he said, <span class="woc">“Why did you falter?” </span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_14_32" data-osis="Matt.14.32"><span class="verse-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span>When they had got into the boat, the wind dropped.</span>
<span class="verse Matt_14_33" data-osis="Matt.14.33"><span class="verse-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span>But the men in the boat threw themselves on their faces before him, and said: “You are indeed God’s Son.”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Matt_14_34" data-osis="Matt.14.34"><span class="verse-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span>When they had crossed over, they landed at Gennesaret.</span>
<span class="verse Matt_14_35" data-osis="Matt.14.35"><span class="verse-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span>But the people of that place, recognizing Jesus, sent out to the whole country around, and brought to him all who were ill,</span>
<span class="verse Matt_14_36" data-osis="Matt.14.36"><span class="verse-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span>begging him merely to let them touch the tassel of his cloak; and all who touched were made perfectly well.</span>

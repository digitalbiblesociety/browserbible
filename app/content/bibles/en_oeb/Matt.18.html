<p>
<span class="verse Matt_18_1" data-osis="Matt.18.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>On the same occasion the disciples came to Jesus, and asked him: “Who is really the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?”</span>
<span class="verse Matt_18_2" data-osis="Matt.18.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>Jesus called a little child to him, and placed it in the middle of them, and then said:</span>
<span class="verse Matt_18_3" data-osis="Matt.18.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">“I tell you, unless you change and become like little children, you will not enter the kingdom of heaven at all.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_18_4" data-osis="Matt.18.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Therefore, anyone who will humble themselves like this child —  that person will be the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_18_5" data-osis="Matt.18.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">And anyone who, for the sake of my name, welcomes even one little child like this, is welcoming me.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_18_6" data-osis="Matt.18.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">But, if anyone puts temptation in the way of one of these little ones who believe in me, it would be best for them to be sunk in the depths of the sea with a great millstone hung around their neck.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_18_7" data-osis="Matt.18.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Alas for the world because of such temptations! There cannot but be temptations but sorrow awaits the person who does the tempting!</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Matt_18_8" data-osis="Matt.18.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">If your hand or your foot causes you to sin, cut it off, and throw it away. It would be better for you to enter the life maimed or lame, than to have both hands, or both feet, and be thrown into the fire that never goes out.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_18_9" data-osis="Matt.18.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">If your eye causes you to sin, take it out, and throw it away. It would be better for you to enter the life with only one eye, than to have both eyes and be thrown into the fires of Gehenna.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_18_10" data-osis="Matt.18.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Beware of despising one of these little ones, for in heaven, I tell you, their angels always see the face of my Father who is in heaven.</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Matt_18_12" data-osis="Matt.18.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">What think you? If a person owns a hundred sheep, and one of them strays, will the person not leave the ninety-nine on the hills, and go and search for the one that is straying?</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_18_13" data-osis="Matt.18.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">And, if they succeed in finding it, I tell you that they rejoice more over that one sheep than over the ninety-nine which did not stray.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_18_14" data-osis="Matt.18.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">So, too, it is the will of my Father who is in heaven that not one of these little ones should be lost.</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Matt_18_15" data-osis="Matt.18.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">If your brother or sister does wrong, go to them and convince them of their fault when you are both alone. If they listen to you, you have won them over.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_18_16" data-osis="Matt.18.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">But, if they do not listen to you, take with you one or two others, so that ‘on the evidence of two or three witnesses, every word may be put beyond dispute.’</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_18_17" data-osis="Matt.18.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">If they refuse to listen to them, speak to the church; and, if they also refuse to listen to the church, treat him as you would a Gentile or a tax-gatherer.</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Matt_18_18" data-osis="Matt.18.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">I tell you, all that you forbid on earth will be held in heaven to be forbidden, and all that you allow on earth will be held in heaven to be allowed.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_18_19" data-osis="Matt.18.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Again, I tell you that, if but two of you on earth agree as to what they will pray for, whatever it be, it will be granted them by my Father who is in heaven.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_18_20" data-osis="Matt.18.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">For where two or three have come together in my name, I am present with them.” </span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Matt_18_21" data-osis="Matt.18.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>Then Peter came up, and said to Jesus: “Master, how often am I to forgive someone who wrongs me? As many as seven times?”</span>
<span class="verse Matt_18_22" data-osis="Matt.18.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>But Jesus answered: <span class="woc">“Not seven times, but ‘seventy times seven.’</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_18_23" data-osis="Matt.18.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Therefore the kingdom of heaven may be compared to a king who wished to settle accounts with his servants.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_18_24" data-osis="Matt.18.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">When he had begun to do so, one of them was brought to him who owed him ten thousand bags of gold;</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_18_25" data-osis="Matt.18.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">and, as he could not pay, his master ordered him to be sold towards the payment of the debt, together with his wife, and his children, and everything that he had.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_18_26" data-osis="Matt.18.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">The servant threw himself down on the ground before him and said ‘Have patience with me, and I will pay you all.’</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_18_27" data-osis="Matt.18.27"><span class="verse-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">The master was moved with compassion; and he let him go, and forgave him the debt.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_18_28" data-osis="Matt.18.28"><span class="verse-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">But, on going out, that same servant came upon one of his fellow servants who owed him a hundred silver coins. Seizing him by the throat, he said ‘Pay what you owe me.’</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_18_29" data-osis="Matt.18.29"><span class="verse-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">His fellow servant threw himself on the ground and begged for mercy. ‘Have patience with me,’ he said, ‘and I will pay you.’</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_18_30" data-osis="Matt.18.30"><span class="verse-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">But the other would not, but went and put him in prison until he should pay his debt.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_18_31" data-osis="Matt.18.31"><span class="verse-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">When his fellow servants saw what had happened, they were greatly distressed, and went to their master and laid the whole matter before him.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_18_32" data-osis="Matt.18.32"><span class="verse-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">So the master sent for the servant, and said to him ‘You wicked servant! When you begged me for mercy, I forgave you the whole of that debt.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_18_33" data-osis="Matt.18.33"><span class="verse-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Shouldn’t you, also, to have shown mercy to your fellow servant, just as I showed mercy to you?’</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_18_34" data-osis="Matt.18.34"><span class="verse-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Then his master, in anger, handed him over to the jailers, until he should pay the whole of his debt.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_18_35" data-osis="Matt.18.35"><span class="verse-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">So, also, will my heavenly Father do to you, unless each one of you forgives his brother or sister from your heart.” </span></span>

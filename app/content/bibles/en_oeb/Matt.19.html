<h4>The Journey to Jerusalem</h4>
<span class="verse Matt_19_1" data-osis="Matt.19.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>At the conclusion of this teaching, Jesus withdrew from Galilee, and went into that district of Judea which is on the other side of the Jordan.</span>
<span class="verse Matt_19_2" data-osis="Matt.19.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>Great crowds followed him, and he cured them there.</span>
<span class="verse Matt_19_3" data-osis="Matt.19.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>Presently some Pharisees came up to him, and, to test him, said: “Has a man the right to divorce his wife for every cause?”</span>
<p>
<span class="verse Matt_19_4" data-osis="Matt.19.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">“Haven’t you read,” </span>replied Jesus, <span class="woc">“that at the beginning the Creator ‘made them male and female,’</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_19_5" data-osis="Matt.19.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">and said — ‘For this reason a man will leave his father and mother, and be united to his wife, and the man and his wife will become one’?</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_19_6" data-osis="Matt.19.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">So that they are no longer two, but one. What God himself, then, has yoked together people must not separate.” </span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_19_7" data-osis="Matt.19.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>“Why, then,” they said, “did Moses direct that a man should ‘serve his wife with a notice of separation and divorce her’?”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Matt_19_8" data-osis="Matt.19.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">“Moses, owing to the hardness of your hearts,” </span>answered Jesus, <span class="woc">“permitted you to divorce your wives, but that was not so at the beginning.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_19_9" data-osis="Matt.19.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">But I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife, except on the ground of some serious sexual sin, and marries another woman, is guilty of adultery.” </span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_19_10" data-osis="Matt.19.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>“If that,” said the disciples, “is the position of a man with regard to his wife, it is better not to marry.”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Matt_19_11" data-osis="Matt.19.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">“It is not everyone,” </span>replied Jesus, <span class="woc">“who can accept this teaching, but only those who have been enabled to do so.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_19_12" data-osis="Matt.19.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Some men, it is true, have from birth been disabled for marriage, while others have been disabled by their fellow men, and others again have disabled themselves for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. Let him accept it who can.” </span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Matt_19_13" data-osis="Matt.19.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>Then some little children were brought to Jesus, for him to place his hands on them, and pray; but the disciples found fault with those who had brought them.</span>
<span class="verse Matt_19_14" data-osis="Matt.19.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>Jesus, however, said: <span class="woc">“Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for it is to the childlike that the kingdom of heaven belongs.” </span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_19_15" data-osis="Matt.19.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>So he placed his hands on them, and then went on his way.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Matt_19_16" data-osis="Matt.19.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>A man came up to Jesus, and said: “Teacher, what good thing must I do to obtain eternal life?”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Matt_19_17" data-osis="Matt.19.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">“Why ask me about goodness?” </span>answered Jesus. <span class="woc">“There is but One who is good. If you want to enter the life, keep the commandments.” </span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_19_18" data-osis="Matt.19.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>“What commandments?” asked the man. <span class="woc">“These,” </span>answered Jesus: — <span class="woc">“‘You must not kill. You must not commit adultery. You must not steal. You must not say what is false about others.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_19_19" data-osis="Matt.19.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Honor your father and your mother.’ And ‘You must love your neighbor as you love yourself.” </span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_19_20" data-osis="Matt.19.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>“I have observed all these,” said the young man. “What is still wanting in me?”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Matt_19_21" data-osis="Matt.19.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">“If you wish to be perfect,” </span>answered Jesus, <span class="woc">“go and sell your property, and give to the poor, and you will have wealth in heaven; then come and follow me.” </span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_19_22" data-osis="Matt.19.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>On hearing these words, the young man went away distressed, for he had great possessions.</span>
<span class="verse Matt_19_23" data-osis="Matt.19.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>At this, Jesus said to his disciples: <span class="woc">“I tell you that a rich person will find it hard to enter the kingdom of heaven!</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_19_24" data-osis="Matt.19.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">I say again, it is easier for a camel to get through a needle’s eye than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of heaven!” </span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_19_25" data-osis="Matt.19.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span>On hearing this, the disciples exclaimed in great astonishment: “Who then can possibly be saved?”</span>
<span class="verse Matt_19_26" data-osis="Matt.19.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span>But Jesus looked at them, and said: <span class="woc">“With people this is impossible, but with God everything is possible.” </span>Then Peter turned and said to Jesus:</span>
<span class="verse Matt_19_27" data-osis="Matt.19.27"><span class="verse-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span>“But we — we left everything, and followed you; what, then, will we have?”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Matt_19_28" data-osis="Matt.19.28"><span class="verse-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">“I tell you,” </span>answered Jesus, <span class="woc">“that at the new creation, ‘when the Son of Man takes his seat on his throne of glory,’ you who followed me will be seated on twelve thrones, as judges of the twelve tribes of Israel.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_19_29" data-osis="Matt.19.29"><span class="verse-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Everyone who has left houses, or brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, or children, or land, for my sake, will receive many times as much, and will ‘gain eternal life.’</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_19_30" data-osis="Matt.19.30"><span class="verse-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">But many who are first now will then be last, and those who are last will be first.</span></span>

<span class="verse Matt_20_1" data-osis="Matt.20.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">For the kingdom of heaven is like an employer who went out in the early morning to hire laborers for his vineyards.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_20_2" data-osis="Matt.20.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">He agreed with the laborers to pay them the standard daily rate of two silver coins, and sent them into his vineyard.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_20_3" data-osis="Matt.20.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">On going out again, about nine o’clock, he saw some others standing in the marketplace, doing nothing.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_20_4" data-osis="Matt.20.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">‘You also may go into my vineyard,’ he said, ‘and I will pay you what is fair.’</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_20_5" data-osis="Matt.20.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">So they went. Going out again about midday and about three o’clock, he did as before.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_20_6" data-osis="Matt.20.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">When he went out about five, he found some others standing there, and said to them ‘Why have you been standing here all day long, doing nothing?’</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_20_7" data-osis="Matt.20.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">‘Because no one has hired us,’ they answered. ‘You also may go into my vineyard,’ he said.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_20_8" data-osis="Matt.20.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">In the evening the owner of the vineyard said to his steward ‘Call the laborers, and pay them their wages, beginning with the last, and ending with the first.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_20_9" data-osis="Matt.20.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Now when those who had been hired about five o’clock went up, they received two silver coins each.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_20_10" data-osis="Matt.20.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">So, when the first went up, they thought that they would receive more, but they also received two silver coins each;</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_20_11" data-osis="Matt.20.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">on which they began to grumble at their employer.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_20_12" data-osis="Matt.20.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">‘These last,’ they said, ‘have done only one hour’s work, and yet you have put them on the same footing with us, who have borne the brunt of the day’s work, and the heat.’</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_20_13" data-osis="Matt.20.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">‘My friend,’ was his reply to one of them, ‘I am not treating you unfairly. Didn’t you agree with me for two silver coins?</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_20_14" data-osis="Matt.20.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Take what belongs to you, and go. I choose to give to this last man the same as to you.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_20_15" data-osis="Matt.20.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Have not I the right to do as I choose with what is mine? Are you envious because I am liberal?’</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_20_16" data-osis="Matt.20.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">So those who are last will be first, and the first last.” </span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Matt_20_17" data-osis="Matt.20.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>When Jesus was on the point of going up to Jerusalem, he gathered the twelve disciples around him by themselves, and said to them as they were on their way:</span>
<span class="verse Matt_20_18" data-osis="Matt.20.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">“Listen! We are going up to Jerusalem; and there the Son of Man will be betrayed to the chief priests and teachers of the law, and they will condemn him to death,</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_20_19" data-osis="Matt.20.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">and give him up to the Gentiles for them to mock, and to scourge, and to crucify; and on the third day he will rise.” </span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Matt_20_20" data-osis="Matt.20.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>Then the mother of Zebedee’s sons came to him with her sons, bowing to the ground, and begging a favor.</span>
<span class="verse Matt_20_21" data-osis="Matt.20.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">“What is it that you want?” </span>he asked. “I want you to say,” she replied, “that in your kingdom these two sons of mine may sit, one on your right, and the other on your left.”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Matt_20_22" data-osis="Matt.20.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">“You do not know what you are asking,” </span>was Jesus’ answer. <span class="woc">“Can you drink the cup that I am to drink?” </span>“Yes,” they exclaimed, “we can.”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Matt_20_23" data-osis="Matt.20.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">“You will indeed drink my cup,” </span>he said, <span class="woc">“but as to a seat at my right and at my left — that is not mine to give, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared by my Father.” </span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_20_24" data-osis="Matt.20.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span>On hearing of this, the ten others were very indignant about the two brothers.</span>
<span class="verse Matt_20_25" data-osis="Matt.20.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span>Jesus, however, called the ten to him, and said: <span class="woc">“The rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them as you know, and their high officials oppress them.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_20_26" data-osis="Matt.20.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Among you it is not so.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_20_27" data-osis="Matt.20.27"><span class="verse-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">No, whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant, and whoever wants to take the first place among you, must be your slave;</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_20_28" data-osis="Matt.20.28"><span class="verse-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">just as the Son of Man came, not to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.” </span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Matt_20_29" data-osis="Matt.20.29"><span class="verse-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span>As they were going out of Jericho, a great crowd followed him.</span>
<span class="verse Matt_20_30" data-osis="Matt.20.30"><span class="verse-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span>Two blind men who were sitting by the roadside, hearing that Jesus was passing, called out: “Take pity on us, Master, Son of David!”</span>
<span class="verse Matt_20_31" data-osis="Matt.20.31"><span class="verse-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span>The crowd told them to be quiet; but the men only called out the louder: “Take pity on us, Master, Son of David!”</span>
<span class="verse Matt_20_32" data-osis="Matt.20.32"><span class="verse-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span>Then Jesus stopped and called them. <span class="woc">“What do you want me to do for you?” </span>he said.</span>
<span class="verse Matt_20_33" data-osis="Matt.20.33"><span class="verse-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span>“Master,” they replied, “we want our eyes to be opened.”</span>
<span class="verse Matt_20_34" data-osis="Matt.20.34"><span class="verse-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span>So Jesus, moved with compassion, touched their eyes, and immediately they recovered their sight, and followed him.</span>

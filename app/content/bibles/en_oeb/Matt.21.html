<h4>The Last Days</h4>
<span class="verse Matt_21_1" data-osis="Matt.21.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>When they had almost reached Jerusalem, having come as far as Bethphage, on the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent on two disciples.</span>
<span class="verse Matt_21_2" data-osis="Matt.21.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">“Go to the village facing you,” </span>he said, <span class="woc">“and you will immediately find an ass tethered, with a foal by her side; untie her, and lead her here for me.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_21_3" data-osis="Matt.21.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">And, if anyone says anything to you, you are to say this —  ‘The Master wants them’; and he will send them at once.” </span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_21_4" data-osis="Matt.21.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>This happened in fulfillment of these words in the prophet —</span>
<span class="verse Matt_21_5" data-osis="Matt.21.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>‘Say to the people of Zion — “Your King is coming to you, gentle, and riding on an ass, and on the foal of a beast of burden.”’</span>
<p>
<span class="verse Matt_21_6" data-osis="Matt.21.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>So the disciples went and did as Jesus had directed them.</span>
<span class="verse Matt_21_7" data-osis="Matt.21.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>They led the ass and the foal back, and, when they had put their cloaks on them, he seated himself on them.</span>
<span class="verse Matt_21_8" data-osis="Matt.21.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>The immense crowd of people spread their cloaks in the road, while some cut branches off the trees, and spread them on the road.</span>
<span class="verse Matt_21_9" data-osis="Matt.21.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>The crowds that led the way, as well as those that followed behind, kept shouting: “God save the Son of David! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord! God save him from on high!”</span>
<span class="verse Matt_21_10" data-osis="Matt.21.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>When he had entered Jerusalem, the whole city was stirred, and asked —</span>
<span class="verse Matt_21_11" data-osis="Matt.21.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>“Who is this?”, to which the crowd replied — “This is the prophet Jesus from Nazareth in Galilee.”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Matt_21_12" data-osis="Matt.21.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>Jesus went into the Temple Courts, and drove out all those who were buying and selling there. He overturned the tables of the money changers, and the seats of the pigeon-dealers,</span>
<span class="verse Matt_21_13" data-osis="Matt.21.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>and said to them: <span class="woc">“Scripture says ‘My house will be called a house of prayer’; but you are making it ‘a den of robbers.’” </span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_21_14" data-osis="Matt.21.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>While he was still in the Temple Courts, some blind and some lame people came up to him, and he cured them.</span>
<span class="verse Matt_21_15" data-osis="Matt.21.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>But, when the chief priests and the teachers of the law saw the wonderful things that Jesus did, and the boys who were calling out in the Temple Courts “God save the Son of David!”, they were indignant,</span>
<span class="verse Matt_21_16" data-osis="Matt.21.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>and said to him: “Do you hear what these boys are saying?”</span>
</p>
<p><span class="woc">“Yes,” </span>answered Jesus; <span class="woc">“but did you never read the words — ‘Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings you have called forth perfect praise’?” </span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Matt_21_17" data-osis="Matt.21.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>Then he left them, and went out of the city to Bethany, and spent the night there.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Matt_21_18" data-osis="Matt.21.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>The next morning, in returning to the city, Jesus became hungry;</span>
<span class="verse Matt_21_19" data-osis="Matt.21.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>and, noticing a solitary fig tree by the roadside, he went up to it, but found nothing on it but leaves. So he said to it: <span class="woc">“Never again will fruit be gathered off you.” </span>And suddenly the fruit tree withered up.</span>
<span class="verse Matt_21_20" data-osis="Matt.21.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>When the disciples saw this, they exclaimed in astonishment: “How suddenly the fig tree withered up!”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Matt_21_21" data-osis="Matt.21.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">“I tell you,” </span>replied Jesus, <span class="woc">“if you have faith, without ever a doubt, you will do what not only what has been done to the fig tree, but, even if you should say to this hill ‘Be lifted up and hurled into the sea!’ it would be done.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_21_22" data-osis="Matt.21.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">And whatever you ask for in your prayers will, if you have faith, be granted you.” </span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Matt_21_23" data-osis="Matt.21.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>After Jesus had come into the Temple Courts, the chief priests and the councillors of the Nation came up to him as he was teaching, and said: “What authority have you to do these things? Who gave you this authority?”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Matt_21_24" data-osis="Matt.21.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">“I, too,” </span>said Jesus in reply, <span class="woc">“will ask you one question; if you will give me an answer to it, then I, also, will tell you what authority I have to act as I do.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_21_25" data-osis="Matt.21.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">It is about John’s baptism. What was its origin? Divine or human?” But they began arguing among themselves: “If we say ‘divine,’ he will say to us ‘Why then didn’t you believe him?’</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_21_26" data-osis="Matt.21.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span>But if we say ‘human,’ we are afraid of the people, for everyone regards John as a prophet.”</span>
<span class="verse Matt_21_27" data-osis="Matt.21.27"><span class="verse-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span>So the answer they gave Jesus was — “We do not know.”</span>
</p>
<p><span class="woc">“Then I,” </span>he said, <span class="woc">“refuse to tell you what authority I have to do these things.</span>
<span class="verse Matt_21_28" data-osis="Matt.21.28"><span class="verse-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">What do you think of this? There was a man who had two sons. He went to the elder and said ‘Go and work in the vineyard today my son.’</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_21_29" data-osis="Matt.21.29"><span class="verse-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">‘Yes, sir,’ he answered; but he did not go.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_21_30" data-osis="Matt.21.30"><span class="verse-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Then the father went to the second son, and said the same. ‘I will not,’ he answered; but afterwards he was sorry and went.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_21_31" data-osis="Matt.21.31"><span class="verse-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Which of the two sons did as his father wished?” </span>“The second,” they said. <span class="woc">“I tell you,” </span>added Jesus, <span class="woc">“that tax-gatherers and prostitutes are going into the kingdom of God before you.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_21_32" data-osis="Matt.21.32"><span class="verse-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">For when John came to you, walking in the path of righteousness, you did not believe him, but tax-gatherers and prostitutes did; and yet you, though you saw this, even then were not sorry, nor did you believe him.</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Matt_21_33" data-osis="Matt.21.33"><span class="verse-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Listen to another parable. A man, who was an employer, once planted a vineyard, put a fence around it, dug a winepress in it, built a tower, and then let it out to tenants and went abroad.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_21_34" data-osis="Matt.21.34"><span class="verse-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">When the time for the grape harvest drew near, he sent his servants to the tenants, to receive his share of the produce.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_21_35" data-osis="Matt.21.35"><span class="verse-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">But the tenants seized his servants, beat one, killed another, and stoned a third.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_21_36" data-osis="Matt.21.36"><span class="verse-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">A second time the owner sent some servants, a larger number than before, and the tenants treated them in the same way.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_21_37" data-osis="Matt.21.37"><span class="verse-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">As a last resource he sent his son to them. ‘They will respect my son,’ he said.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_21_38" data-osis="Matt.21.38"><span class="verse-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">But the tenants, on seeing his son, said to each other ‘Here is the heir! Come, let us kill him, and get his inheritance.’</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_21_39" data-osis="Matt.21.39"><span class="verse-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">So they seized him, and threw him outside the vineyard, and killed him.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_21_40" data-osis="Matt.21.40"><span class="verse-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Now, when the owner of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those tenants?” </span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_21_41" data-osis="Matt.21.41"><span class="verse-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span>“Miserable wretches!” they exclaimed, “he will put them to a miserable death, and he will let out the vineyard to other tenants, who will pay him his share of the produce at the proper times.”</span>
<span class="verse Matt_21_42" data-osis="Matt.21.42"><span class="verse-num v-42">42&nbsp;</span>Then Jesus added: <span class="woc">“Have you never read in the scriptures? —  ‘The  stone which the builders despised — Has now itself become the corner-stone; This corner-stone has come from the Lord, and is marvelous in our eyes.’</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_21_43" data-osis="Matt.21.43"><span class="verse-num v-43">43&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">That, I tell you, is why the kingdom of God will be taken from you, and given to a nation that does produce the fruit of the kingdom.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_21_44" data-osis="Matt.21.44"><span class="verse-num v-44">44&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Yes, and he who falls on this stone will be dashed to pieces, while anyone on whom it falls — it will scatter him as dust.” </span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Matt_21_45" data-osis="Matt.21.45"><span class="verse-num v-45">45&nbsp;</span>After listening to these parables, the chief priests and the Pharisees saw that it was about them that he was speaking;</span>
<span class="verse Matt_21_46" data-osis="Matt.21.46"><span class="verse-num v-46">46&nbsp;</span>yet, although eager to arrest him, they were afraid of the crowds, who regarded him as a prophet.</span>

<p>
<span class="verse Matt_22_1" data-osis="Matt.22.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>Once more Jesus spoke to them in parables.</span>
<span class="verse Matt_22_2" data-osis="Matt.22.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">“The kingdom of heaven,” he said, “may be compared to a king who gave a banquet in honor of his son’s wedding.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_22_3" data-osis="Matt.22.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">He sent his servants to call those who had been invited to the banquet, but they were unwilling to come.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_22_4" data-osis="Matt.22.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">A second time he sent some servants, with orders to say to those who had been invited ‘I have prepared my breakfast, my cattle and fat beasts are killed and everything is ready; come to the banquet.’</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_22_5" data-osis="Matt.22.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">They, however, took no notice, but went off, one to their farm, another to their business;</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_22_6" data-osis="Matt.22.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">while the rest, seizing his servants, ill-treated them and killed them.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_22_7" data-osis="Matt.22.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">The king, in anger, sent his troops, put those murderers to death, and set their city on fire.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_22_8" data-osis="Matt.22.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Then he said to his servants ‘The banquet is prepared, but those who were invited were not worthy.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_22_9" data-osis="Matt.22.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">So go to the cross-roads, and invite everyone you find to the banquet.’</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_22_10" data-osis="Matt.22.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">The servants went out into the roads and collected all the people whom they found, whether bad or good; and the bridal-hall was filled with guests.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_22_11" data-osis="Matt.22.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">But, when the king went in to see his guests, he noticed there a man who had not put on a wedding-robe.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_22_12" data-osis="Matt.22.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">So he said to him ‘My friend, how is it that you came in here without a wedding-robe?’ The man was speechless.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_22_13" data-osis="Matt.22.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Then the king said to the attendants ‘Tie him hand and foot, and ‘put him out into the darkness’ outside, where there will be weeping and grinding of teeth.’</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_22_14" data-osis="Matt.22.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">For many are called, but few chosen.” </span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Matt_22_15" data-osis="Matt.22.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>Then the Pharisees went away and conferred together as to how they might lay a trap for Jesus in the course of conversation.</span>
<span class="verse Matt_22_16" data-osis="Matt.22.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>They sent their disciples, with the Herodians, to say to him: “Teacher, we know that you are an honest person, and that you teach the way of God honestly, and are not afraid of anyone; for you pay no regard to a person’s position.</span>
<span class="verse Matt_22_17" data-osis="Matt.22.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>Tell us, then, what you think. Are we right in paying taxes to the Emperor, or not?”</span>
<span class="verse Matt_22_18" data-osis="Matt.22.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>Perceiving their malice, Jesus answered: <span class="woc">“Why are you testing me, you hypocrites?</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_22_19" data-osis="Matt.22.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Show me the coin with which the tax is paid.” </span>And, when they had brought him a coin,</span>
<span class="verse Matt_22_20" data-osis="Matt.22.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>he asked: <span class="woc">“Whose head and title are these?” </span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_22_21" data-osis="Matt.22.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>“The Emperor’s,” they answered: on which he said to them: <span class="woc">“Then pay to the Emperor what belongs to the Emperor, and to God what belongs to God.” </span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_22_22" data-osis="Matt.22.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>They wondered at his answer, and left him alone and went away.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Matt_22_23" data-osis="Matt.22.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>That same day some Sadducees came up to Jesus, maintaining that there is no resurrection. Their question was this: —</span>
<span class="verse Matt_22_24" data-osis="Matt.22.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span>“Teacher, Moses said — ‘should a man die without children, the man’s brother will become the husband of the widow, and raise a family for his brother.’</span>
<span class="verse Matt_22_25" data-osis="Matt.22.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span>Now we had living among us seven brothers; of whom the eldest married and died, and, as he had no family, left his wife for his brother.</span>
<span class="verse Matt_22_26" data-osis="Matt.22.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span>The same thing happened to the second and the third brothers, and indeed to all the seven.</span>
<span class="verse Matt_22_27" data-osis="Matt.22.27"><span class="verse-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span>The woman herself died last of all.</span>
<span class="verse Matt_22_28" data-osis="Matt.22.28"><span class="verse-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span>At the resurrection, then, whose wife will she be out of the seven, all of them having been married to her?”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Matt_22_29" data-osis="Matt.22.29"><span class="verse-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">“Your mistake,” </span>replied Jesus, <span class="woc">“is due to your ignorance of the scriptures, and of the power of God.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_22_30" data-osis="Matt.22.30"><span class="verse-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">For at the resurrection there is no marrying or being married, but all who rise are as angels in heaven.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_22_31" data-osis="Matt.22.31"><span class="verse-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">As to the resurrection of the dead, have you not read these words of God — </span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_22_32" data-osis="Matt.22.32"><span class="verse-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">‘I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob’? He is not the God of dead people, but of living.” </span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_22_33" data-osis="Matt.22.33"><span class="verse-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span>The crowds, who had been listening to him, were greatly struck with his teaching.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Matt_22_34" data-osis="Matt.22.34"><span class="verse-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span>When the Pharisees heard that Jesus had silenced the Sadducees, they collected together.</span>
<span class="verse Matt_22_35" data-osis="Matt.22.35"><span class="verse-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span>Then one of them, a Student of the law, to test him, asked this question —</span>
<span class="verse Matt_22_36" data-osis="Matt.22.36"><span class="verse-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span>“Teacher, what is the great commandment in the law?”</span>
<span class="verse Matt_22_37" data-osis="Matt.22.37"><span class="verse-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span>His answer was: <span class="woc">“‘You must love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind.’</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_22_38" data-osis="Matt.22.38"><span class="verse-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">This is the great first commandment.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_22_39" data-osis="Matt.22.39"><span class="verse-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">The second, which is like it, is this — ‘You must love your neighbor as you love yourself.’</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_22_40" data-osis="Matt.22.40"><span class="verse-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.” </span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_22_41" data-osis="Matt.22.41"><span class="verse-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span>Before the Pharisees separated, Jesus put this question to them —</span>
<span class="verse Matt_22_42" data-osis="Matt.22.42"><span class="verse-num v-42">42&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">“What do you think about the Christ? Whose son is he?” </span>“David’s,” they said.</span>
<span class="verse Matt_22_43" data-osis="Matt.22.43"><span class="verse-num v-43">43&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">“How is it, then,” </span>Jesus replied, <span class="woc">“that David, speaking under inspiration, calls him ‘lord,’ in the passage — </span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_22_44" data-osis="Matt.22.44"><span class="verse-num v-44">44&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">‘The Lord said to my Lord: “Sit at my right hand, until I put your enemies beneath your feet”’?</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_22_45" data-osis="Matt.22.45"><span class="verse-num v-45">45&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Since, then, David calls him ‘lord,’ how is he David’s son?” </span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_22_46" data-osis="Matt.22.46"><span class="verse-num v-46">46&nbsp;</span>No one could say a word in answer; nor did anyone after that day venture to question him further.</span>

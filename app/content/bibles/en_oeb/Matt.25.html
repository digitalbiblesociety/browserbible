<span class="verse Matt_25_1" data-osis="Matt.25.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Then the kingdom of heaven will be like ten bridesmaids who took their lamps and went out to meet the groom.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_25_2" data-osis="Matt.25.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Five of them were foolish, and five were prudent.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_25_3" data-osis="Matt.25.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">The foolish ones took their lamps, but took no oil with them;</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_25_4" data-osis="Matt.25.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">while the prudent ones, besides taking their lamps, took oil in their jars.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_25_5" data-osis="Matt.25.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">As the groom was late in coming, they all became drowsy, and slept.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_25_6" data-osis="Matt.25.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">But at midnight a shout was raised — ‘The groom is coming! Come out to meet him!’</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_25_7" data-osis="Matt.25.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Then all the bridesmaids woke up and trimmed their lamps,</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_25_8" data-osis="Matt.25.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">and the foolish said to the prudent ‘Give us some of your oil; our lamps are going out.’</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_25_9" data-osis="Matt.25.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">But the prudent ones answered ‘No, There may not be enough for you and for us. Go instead to those who sell it, and buy for yourselves.’</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_25_10" data-osis="Matt.25.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">But while they were on their way to buy it, the groom came; and the bridesmaids who were ready went in with him to the banquet, and the door was shut.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_25_11" data-osis="Matt.25.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Afterwards the other bridesmaids came. ‘Sir, Sir,’ they said, ‘open the door to us!’</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_25_12" data-osis="Matt.25.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">But the groom answered ‘I tell you, I do not know you.’</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_25_13" data-osis="Matt.25.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Therefore watch, since you know neither the day nor the hour.</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Matt_25_14" data-osis="Matt.25.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">For it is as though a man, going on his travels, called his servants, and gave his property into their charge.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_25_15" data-osis="Matt.25.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">He gave five bags of gold to one, two to another, and one bag to a third, in proportion to the ability of each. Then he set out on his travels.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_25_16" data-osis="Matt.25.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">The servant who had received the five bags of gold went at once and traded with it, and made another five bags.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_25_17" data-osis="Matt.25.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">So, too, the servant who had received the two bags of gold made another two bags.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_25_18" data-osis="Matt.25.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">But the servant who had received the one bag went and dug a hole in the ground, and hid his master’s money.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_25_19" data-osis="Matt.25.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">After a long time the master of those servants returned, and settled accounts with them.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_25_20" data-osis="Matt.25.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">The servant who had received the five bags of gold came up and brought five bags more. ‘Sir,’ he said, ‘you entrusted me with five bags of gold; look, I have made another five bags!’</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_25_21" data-osis="Matt.25.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">‘Well done, good, trustworthy servant!’ said his master. ‘You have been trustworthy with a small sum; now I will place a large one in your hands; come and share your master’s joy!’</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_25_22" data-osis="Matt.25.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Then the one who had received the two bags of gold came up and said ‘Sir, you entrusted me with two bags pounds; look, I have made another two!’</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_25_23" data-osis="Matt.25.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">‘Well done, good, trustworthy servant!’ said his master. ‘You have been trustworthy with a small sum; now I will place a large one in your hands; come and share your master’s joy!’</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_25_24" data-osis="Matt.25.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">The man who had received the single bag of gold came up, too, and said ‘Sir, I knew that you were a hard man; you reap where you have not sown, and gather up where you have not winnowed;</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_25_25" data-osis="Matt.25.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">and, in my fear, I went and hid your money in the ground; look, here is what belongs to you!’</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_25_26" data-osis="Matt.25.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">‘You lazy, worthless servant!’ was his master’s reply. ‘You knew that I reap where I have not sown, and gather up where I have not winnowed?</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_25_27" data-osis="Matt.25.27"><span class="verse-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Then you ought to have placed my money in the hands of bankers, and I, on my return, should have received my money, with interest.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_25_28" data-osis="Matt.25.28"><span class="verse-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">‘Therefore,’ he continued, ‘take away from him the one bag of gold, and give it to the one who has the ten bags.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_25_29" data-osis="Matt.25.29"><span class="verse-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">For, to him who has, more will be given, and he will have abundance; but, as for him who has nothing, even what he has will be taken away from him.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_25_30" data-osis="Matt.25.30"><span class="verse-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">As for the useless servant, ‘put him out into the darkness’ outside, where there will be weeping and grinding of teeth.’</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Matt_25_31" data-osis="Matt.25.31"><span class="verse-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">When the Son of Man has come in his glory and all the angels with him, then he ‘will take his seat on his throne of glory’;</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_25_32" data-osis="Matt.25.32"><span class="verse-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">and all the nations will be gathered before him, and he will separate the people — just as a shepherd separates sheep from goats — </span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_25_33" data-osis="Matt.25.33"><span class="verse-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">placing the sheep on his right hand, and the goats on his left.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_25_34" data-osis="Matt.25.34"><span class="verse-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Then the king will say to those on his right ‘Come, you who are blessed by my Father, enter into possession of the kingdom prepared for you ever since the beginning of the world.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_25_35" data-osis="Matt.25.35"><span class="verse-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">For, when I was hungry, you gave me food; when I was thirsty, you gave me drink; when I was a stranger, you took me to your homes;</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_25_36" data-osis="Matt.25.36"><span class="verse-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">when I was naked, you clothed me; when I fell ill, you visited me; and when I was in prison, you came to me.’</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_25_37" data-osis="Matt.25.37"><span class="verse-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Then the righteous will answer ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry, and feed you? Or thirsty, and give you a drink?</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_25_38" data-osis="Matt.25.38"><span class="verse-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">When did we see you a stranger, and take you to our homes? Or naked, and clothe you?</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_25_39" data-osis="Matt.25.39"><span class="verse-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">When did we see you ill, or in prison, and come to you?’</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_25_40" data-osis="Matt.25.40"><span class="verse-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">And the king will reply ‘I tell you, as often as you did it to one of these my brothers or sisters, however unimportant they seemed, you did it to me.’</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_25_41" data-osis="Matt.25.41"><span class="verse-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Then he will say to those on his left ‘Go from my presence, accursed, into the ‘permanent fire which has been prepared for the devil and his angels.’</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_25_42" data-osis="Matt.25.42"><span class="verse-num v-42">42&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">For, when I was hungry, you gave me no food; when I was thirsty, you gave me no drink;</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_25_43" data-osis="Matt.25.43"><span class="verse-num v-43">43&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">when I was a stranger, you did not take me to your homes; when I was naked, you did not clothe me; and, when I was ill and in prison, you did not visit me.’</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_25_44" data-osis="Matt.25.44"><span class="verse-num v-44">44&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Then they, in their turn, will answer ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry, or thirsty, or a stranger, or naked, or ill, or in prison, and did not supply your wants?’</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_25_45" data-osis="Matt.25.45"><span class="verse-num v-45">45&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">And then he will reply ‘I tell you, as often as you failed to do it to one of these, however unimportant, you failed to do it to me.’</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_25_46" data-osis="Matt.25.46"><span class="verse-num v-46">46&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">And these last will go away ‘into lasting correction,’ but the righteous ‘into lasting life.’” </span></span>

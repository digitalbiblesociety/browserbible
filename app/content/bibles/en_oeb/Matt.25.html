<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.25.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Then the Kingdom of Heaven will be like ten bridesmaids who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.25.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Five of them were foolish, and five were prudent.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.25.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> The foolish ones took their lamps, but took no oil with them;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.25.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> while the prudent ones, besides taking their lamps, took oil in their jars.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.25.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> As the bridegroom was late in coming, they all became drowsy, and slept.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.25.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> But at midnight a shout was raised &mdash; &lsquo;The Bridegroom is coming! Come out to meet him!&rsquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.25.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Then all the bridesmaids awoke and trimmed their lamps.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.25.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> And the foolish said to the prudent &lsquo;Give us some of your oil; our lamps are going out.&rsquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.25.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> But the prudent ones answered &lsquo;No, for fear that there will not be enough for you and for us. Go instead to those who sell it, and buy for yourselves.&rsquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.25.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> But while they were on their way to buy it, the bridegroom came; and the bridesmaids who were ready went in with him to the banquet, and the door was shut.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.25.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Afterwards the other bridesmaids came. &lsquo;Sir, Sir,&rsquo; they said, &lsquo;open the door to us!&rsquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.25.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> But the bridegroom answered &lsquo;I tell you, I do not know you.&rsquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.25.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Therefore watch, since you know neither the Day nor the Hour.</span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.25.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> For it is as though a man, going on his travels, called his servants, and gave his property into their charge.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.25.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> He gave three thousand pounds to one, twelve hundred to another, and six hundred to a third, in proportion to the ability of each. Then he set out on his travels.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.25.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> The man who had received the three thousand pounds went at once and traded with it, and made another three thousand.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.25.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> So, too, the man who had received the twelve hundred pounds made another twelve hundred.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.25.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> But the man who had received the six hundred went and dug a hole in the ground, and hid his master&rsquo;s money.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.25.19"><span class="verse-num">19&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> After a long time the master of those servants returned, and settled accounts with them.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.25.20"><span class="verse-num">20&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> The man who had received the three thousand pounds came up and brought three thousand more. &lsquo;Sir,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;you entrusted me with three thousand pounds; look, I have made another three thousand!&rsquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.25.21"><span class="verse-num">21&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &lsquo;Well done, good, trustworthy servant!&rsquo; said his master. &lsquo;You have been trustworthy with a small sum; now I will place a large one in your hands; come and share your master&rsquo;s joy!&rsquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.25.22"><span class="verse-num">22&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Then the one who had received the twelve hundred pounds came up and said &lsquo;Sir, you entrusted me with twelve hundred pounds; look, I have made another twelve hundred!&rsquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.25.23"><span class="verse-num">23&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &lsquo;Well done, good, trustworthy servant!&rsquo; said his master. &lsquo;You have been trustworthy with a small sum; now I will place a large one in your hands; come and share your master&rsquo;s joy!&rsquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.25.24"><span class="verse-num">24&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> The man who had received the six hundred pounds came up, too, and said &lsquo;Sir, I knew that you were a hard man; you reap where you have not sown, and gather up where you have not winnowed;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.25.25"><span class="verse-num">25&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> and, in my fear, I went and hid your money in the ground; look, here is what belongs to you!&rsquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.25.26"><span class="verse-num">26&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &lsquo;You lazy, worthless servant!&rsquo; was his master&rsquo;s reply. &lsquo;You knew that I reap where I have not sown, and gather up where I have not winnowed?</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.25.27"><span class="verse-num">27&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Then you ought to have placed my money in the hands of bankers, and I, on my return, should have received my money, with interest.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.25.28"><span class="verse-num">28&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &lsquo;Therefore,&rsquo; he continued, &lsquo;take away from him the six hundred pounds, and give it to the one who has the six thousand.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.25.29"><span class="verse-num">29&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> For, to him who has, more will be given, and he shall have abundance; but, as for him who has nothing, even what he has will be taken away from him.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.25.30"><span class="verse-num">30&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> As for the useless servant, &lsquo;put him out into the darkness&rsquo; outside, where there will be weeping and grinding of teeth.&rsquo;</span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.25.31"><span class="verse-num">31&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> When the Son of Man has come in his glory and all the angels with him, then he &lsquo;will take his seat on his throne of glory&rsquo;;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.25.32"><span class="verse-num">32&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> and all the nations will be gathered before him, and he will separate the people &mdash; just as a shepherd separates sheep from goats &mdash; </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.25.33"><span class="verse-num">33&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> placing the sheep on his right hand, and the goats on his left.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.25.34"><span class="verse-num">34&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Then the King will say to those on his right &lsquo;Come, you who are blessed by my Father, enter upon possession of the Kingdom prepared for you ever since the beginning of the world.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.25.35"><span class="verse-num">35&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> For, when I was hungry, you gave me food; when I was thirsty, you gave me drink; when I was a stranger, you took me to your homes;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.25.36"><span class="verse-num">36&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> when I was naked, you clothed me; when I fell ill, you visited me; and when I was in prison, you came to me.&rsquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.25.37"><span class="verse-num">37&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Then the Righteous will answer &lsquo;Lord, when did we see you hungry, and feed you? Or thirsty, and give you a drink?</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.25.38"><span class="verse-num">38&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> When did we see you a stranger, and take you to our homes? Or naked, and clothe you?</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.25.39"><span class="verse-num">39&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> When did we see you ill, or in prison, and come to you?&rsquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.25.40"><span class="verse-num">40&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> And the King will reply &lsquo;I tell you, as often as you did it to one of these my Brothers, however lowly, you did it to me.&rsquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.25.41"><span class="verse-num">41&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Then he will say to those on his left &lsquo;Go from my presence, accursed, into the &lsquo;aeonian fire which has been prepared for the Devil and his angels.&rsquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.25.42"><span class="verse-num">42&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> For, when I was hungry, you gave me no food; when I was thirsty, you gave me no drink;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.25.43"><span class="verse-num">43&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> when I was a stranger, you did not take me to your homes; when I was naked, you did not clothe me; and, when I was ill and in prison, you did not visit me.&rsquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.25.44"><span class="verse-num">44&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Then they, in their turn, will answer &lsquo;Lord, when did we see you hungry, or thirsty, or a stranger, or naked, or ill, or in prison, and did not supply your wants?&rsquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.25.45"><span class="verse-num">45&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> And then he will reply &lsquo;I tell you, as often as you failed to do it to one of these, however lowly, you failed to do it to me.&rsquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.25.46"><span class="verse-num">46&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> And these last will go away &lsquo;into aeonian punishment,&rsquo; but the righteous &lsquo;into aeonian life.&rsquo;&rdquo; </span></span>

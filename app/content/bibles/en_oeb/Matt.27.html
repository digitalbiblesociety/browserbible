<h2 class="chapter-num">27</h2>
<p>
<span class="verse Matt_27_1" data-osis="Matt.27.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>At daybreak all the Chief Priests and the Councillors of the Nation consulted together against Jesus, to bring about his death.</span>
<span class="verse Matt_27_2" data-osis="Matt.27.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>They put him in chains and led him away, and gave him up to the Roman Governor, Pilate.</span>
<span class="verse Matt_27_3" data-osis="Matt.27.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>Then Judas, who betrayed him, seeing that Jesus was condemned, repented of what he had done, and returned the thirty pieces of silver to the Chief Priests and Councillors.</span>
<span class="verse Matt_27_4" data-osis="Matt.27.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;I did wrong in betraying a good man to his death,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;What has that to do with us?&rdquo; they replied. &ldquo;You must see to that yourself.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Matt_27_5" data-osis="Matt.27.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>Judas flung down the pieces of silver in the Temple, and left; and went away and hanged himself.</span>
<span class="verse Matt_27_6" data-osis="Matt.27.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>The Chief Priests took the pieces of silver, but they said: &ldquo;We must not put them into the Temple treasury, because they are blood-money.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Matt_27_7" data-osis="Matt.27.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>So, after consultation, they bought with them the &lsquo;Potter&rsquo;s Field&rsquo; for a burial-ground for foreigners;</span>
<span class="verse Matt_27_8" data-osis="Matt.27.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>and that is why that field is called the &lsquo;Field of Blood&rsquo; to this very day.</span>
<span class="verse Matt_27_9" data-osis="Matt.27.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>Then it was that these words spoken by the Prophet Jeremiah were fulfilled &mdash;  &lsquo;They took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him who was valued, whom some of the people of Israel valued,</span>
<span class="verse Matt_27_10" data-osis="Matt.27.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>and gave them for the Potter&rsquo;s field, as the Lord commanded me.&rsquo;</span>
<span class="verse Matt_27_11" data-osis="Matt.27.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>Meanwhile Jesus was brought before the Roman Governor. &ldquo;Are you the King of the Jews?&rdquo; asked the Governor. <span class="woc"> &ldquo;It is true,&rdquo; </span>  answered Jesus.</span>
<span class="verse Matt_27_12" data-osis="Matt.27.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>While charges were being brought against him by the Chief Priests and Councillors, Jesus made no reply.</span>
<span class="verse Matt_27_13" data-osis="Matt.27.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>Then Pilate said to him: &ldquo;Do not you hear how many accusations they are making against you?&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Matt_27_14" data-osis="Matt.27.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>Yet Jesus made no reply &mdash; not even a single word; at which the Governor was greatly astonished.</span>
<span class="verse Matt_27_15" data-osis="Matt.27.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>Now, at the Feast, the Governor was accustomed to grant the people the release of any one prisoner whom they might choose.</span>
<span class="verse Matt_27_16" data-osis="Matt.27.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>At that time they had a notorious prisoner called Barabbas.</span>
<span class="verse Matt_27_17" data-osis="Matt.27.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>So, when the people had collected, Pilate said to them: &ldquo;Which do you wish me to release for you? Barabbas? Or Jesus who is called &lsquo;Christ&rsquo;?&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Matt_27_18" data-osis="Matt.27.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>For he knew that it was out of jealousy that they had given Jesus up to him.</span>
<span class="verse Matt_27_19" data-osis="Matt.27.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>While he was still on the Bench, his wife sent this message to him &mdash; &ldquo;Do not have anything to do with that good man, for I have been very unhappy to-day in a dream on account of him.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Matt_27_20" data-osis="Matt.27.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>But the Chief Priests and the Councillors persuaded the crowds to ask for Barabbas, and to kill Jesus.</span>
<span class="verse Matt_27_21" data-osis="Matt.27.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>The Governor, however, said to them: &ldquo;Which of these two do you wish me to release for you?&rdquo; &ldquo;Barabbas,&rdquo; they answered.</span>
<span class="verse Matt_27_22" data-osis="Matt.27.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;What then,&rdquo; Pilate asked, &ldquo;shall I do with Jesus who is called &lsquo;Christ?&rsquo; &ldquo;Let him be crucified,&rdquo; they all replied.</span>
<span class="verse Matt_27_23" data-osis="Matt.27.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Why, what harm has he done?&rdquo; he asked. But they kept shouting furiously: &ldquo;Let him be crucified!&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Matt_27_24" data-osis="Matt.27.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span>When Pilate saw that his efforts were unavailing, but that, on the contrary, a riot was beginning, he took some water, and washed his hands in the sight of the crowd, saying as he did so: &ldquo;I am not answerable for this bloodshed; you must see to it yourselves.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Matt_27_25" data-osis="Matt.27.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span>And all the people answered: &ldquo;His blood be on our heads and on our children&rsquo;s!&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Matt_27_26" data-osis="Matt.27.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span>The Pilate released Barabbas to them; but Jesus he scourged, and gave him up to be crucified.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Matt_27_27" data-osis="Matt.27.27"><span class="verse-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span>After that, the Governor&rsquo;s soldiers took Jesus with them into the Government House, and gathered the whole garrison round him.</span>
<span class="verse Matt_27_28" data-osis="Matt.27.28"><span class="verse-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span>They stripped him, and put on him a red military cloak,</span>
<span class="verse Matt_27_29" data-osis="Matt.27.29"><span class="verse-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span>and having twisted some thorns into a crown, put it on his head, and a rod in his right hand, and then, going down on their knees before him, they mocked him. &ldquo;Long life to you, King of the Jews!&rdquo; they said.</span>
<span class="verse Matt_27_30" data-osis="Matt.27.30"><span class="verse-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span>They spat at him and, taking the rod, kept striking him on the head;</span>
<span class="verse Matt_27_31" data-osis="Matt.27.31"><span class="verse-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span>and, when they had left off mocking him, they took off the military cloak, and put his own clothes on him, and led him away to be crucified.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Matt_27_32" data-osis="Matt.27.32"><span class="verse-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span>As they were on their way out, they came upon a man from Cyrene of the name of Simon; and they compelled him to go with them to carry the cross.</span>
<span class="verse Matt_27_33" data-osis="Matt.27.33"><span class="verse-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span>On reaching a place named Golgotha (a place named from its likeness to a skull),</span>
<span class="verse Matt_27_34" data-osis="Matt.27.34"><span class="verse-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span>they gave him some wine to drink which had been mixed with gall; but after tasting it, Jesus refused to drink it.</span>
<span class="verse Matt_27_35" data-osis="Matt.27.35"><span class="verse-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span>When they had crucified him, they divided his clothes among them by casting lots.</span>
<span class="verse Matt_27_36" data-osis="Matt.27.36"><span class="verse-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span>Then they sat down, and kept watch over him there.</span>
<span class="verse Matt_27_37" data-osis="Matt.27.37"><span class="verse-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span>Above his head they fixed the accusation against him written out &mdash; &lsquo;THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.&rsquo;</span>
<span class="verse Matt_27_38" data-osis="Matt.27.38"><span class="verse-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span>At the same time two robbers were crucified with him, one on the right, the other on the left.</span>
<span class="verse Matt_27_39" data-osis="Matt.27.39"><span class="verse-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span>The passers-by railed at him, shaking their heads as they said:</span>
<span class="verse Matt_27_40" data-osis="Matt.27.40"><span class="verse-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;You who &lsquo;destroy the Temple and build one in three days,&rsquo; save yourself! If you are God&rsquo;s Son, come down from the cross!&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Matt_27_41" data-osis="Matt.27.41"><span class="verse-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span>In the same way the Chief Priests, with the Teaches of the Law and Councillors, said in mockery:</span>
<span class="verse Matt_27_42" data-osis="Matt.27.42"><span class="verse-num v-42">42&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;He saved others, but he cannot save himself! He is the &lsquo;King of Israel&rsquo;! Let him come down from the cross now, and we will believe in him.</span>
<span class="verse Matt_27_43" data-osis="Matt.27.43"><span class="verse-num v-43">43&nbsp;</span>He has trusted in God; if God wants him, let him deliver him now; for he said &lsquo;I am God&rsquo;s Son.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Matt_27_44" data-osis="Matt.27.44"><span class="verse-num v-44">44&nbsp;</span>Even the robbers, who were crucified with him, reviled him in the same way.</span>
<span class="verse Matt_27_45" data-osis="Matt.27.45"><span class="verse-num v-45">45&nbsp;</span>After mid-day a darkness came over all the country, lasting till three in the afternoon.</span>
<span class="verse Matt_27_46" data-osis="Matt.27.46"><span class="verse-num v-46">46&nbsp;</span>And about three Jesus called out loudly: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Eloi, Eloi, lema sabacthani&rdquo; </span>  &mdash; that is to say, <span class="woc"> &lsquo;O my God, my God, why has thou forsaken me?&rsquo;</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_27_47" data-osis="Matt.27.47"><span class="verse-num v-47">47&nbsp;</span>Some of those standing by heard this, and said: &ldquo;The man is calling for Elijah!&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Matt_27_48" data-osis="Matt.27.48"><span class="verse-num v-48">48&nbsp;</span>One of them immediately ran and took a sponge, and, filling it with common wine, put it on the end of a rod, and offered it to him to drink.</span>
<span class="verse Matt_27_49" data-osis="Matt.27.49"><span class="verse-num v-49">49&nbsp;</span>But the rest said: &ldquo;Wait and let us see if Elijah is coming to save him.&rdquo; However another man took a spear, and pierced his side; and water and blood flowed from it.</span>
<span class="verse Matt_27_50" data-osis="Matt.27.50"><span class="verse-num v-50">50&nbsp;</span>But Jesus, uttering another loud cry, gave up his spirit.</span>
<span class="verse Matt_27_51" data-osis="Matt.27.51"><span class="verse-num v-51">51&nbsp;</span>Suddenly the Temple curtain was torn in two from top to bottom, the earth shook, the rocks were torn asunder,</span>
<span class="verse Matt_27_52" data-osis="Matt.27.52"><span class="verse-num v-52">52&nbsp;</span>the tombs opened, and the bodies of many of God&rsquo;s People who had fallen asleep rose,</span>
<span class="verse Matt_27_53" data-osis="Matt.27.53"><span class="verse-num v-53">53&nbsp;</span>and they, leaving their tombs, went, after the resurrection of Jesus, into the Holy City, and appeared to many people.</span>
<span class="verse Matt_27_54" data-osis="Matt.27.54"><span class="verse-num v-54">54&nbsp;</span>The Roman Captain, and the men with him who were watching Jesus, on seeing the earthquake and all that was happening, became greatly frightened and exclaimed: &ldquo;This must indeed have been God&rsquo;s Son!&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Matt_27_55" data-osis="Matt.27.55"><span class="verse-num v-55">55&nbsp;</span>There were many women there, watching from a distance, who had accompanied Jesus from Galilee and had been attending on him.</span>
<span class="verse Matt_27_56" data-osis="Matt.27.56"><span class="verse-num v-56">56&nbsp;</span>Among them were Mary of Magdala, Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of Zebediah&rsquo;s sons.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Matt_27_57" data-osis="Matt.27.57"><span class="verse-num v-57">57&nbsp;</span>When evening had fallen, there came a rich man belonging to Ramah, named Joseph, who had himself become a disciple of Jesus.</span>
<span class="verse Matt_27_58" data-osis="Matt.27.58"><span class="verse-num v-58">58&nbsp;</span>He went to see Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus; upon which Pilate ordered it to be given him.</span>
<span class="verse Matt_27_59" data-osis="Matt.27.59"><span class="verse-num v-59">59&nbsp;</span>So Joseph took the body, and wrapped it in a clean linen sheet,</span>
<span class="verse Matt_27_60" data-osis="Matt.27.60"><span class="verse-num v-60">60&nbsp;</span>and laid it in his newly-made tomb which he had cut in the rock; and, before he left, he rolled a great stone against the entrance of the tomb.</span>
<span class="verse Matt_27_61" data-osis="Matt.27.61"><span class="verse-num v-61">61&nbsp;</span>Mary of Magdala and the other Mary remained behind, sitting in front of the grave.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Matt_27_62" data-osis="Matt.27.62"><span class="verse-num v-62">62&nbsp;</span>The next day &mdash; that is, the day following the Preparation-Day &mdash; the Chief Priests and Pharisees came in a body to Pilate, and said:</span>
<span class="verse Matt_27_63" data-osis="Matt.27.63"><span class="verse-num v-63">63&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Sir, we remember that, during his lifetime, that impostor said <span class="woc"> &lsquo;I shall rise after three days.&rsquo;</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_27_64" data-osis="Matt.27.64"><span class="verse-num v-64">64&nbsp;</span>So order the tomb to be made secure till the third day. Otherwise his disciples may come and steal him, and then say to the people &lsquo;He has risen from the dead,&rsquo; when the latest imposture will be worse than the first.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Matt_27_65" data-osis="Matt.27.65"><span class="verse-num v-65">65&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;You may have a guard,&rdquo; was Pilate&rsquo;s reply; &ldquo;go and make the tomb as secure as you can.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Matt_27_66" data-osis="Matt.27.66"><span class="verse-num v-66">66&nbsp;</span>So they went made the tomb secure, by sealing the stone, in presence of the guard.</span>

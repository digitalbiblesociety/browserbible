<h4>The Preparation</h4>
<span class="verse Matt_3_1" data-osis="Matt.3.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>About that time John the Baptist first appeared, proclaiming in the wilderness of Judea:</span>
<span class="verse Matt_3_2" data-osis="Matt.3.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>“Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.”</span>
<span class="verse Matt_3_3" data-osis="Matt.3.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>John was the one who was spoken of in the prophet Isaiah, where he says —<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘The voice of one crying aloud in the wilderness:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Make ready the way of the Lord,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;make his paths straight.”’</span>
<p>
<span class="verse Matt_3_4" data-osis="Matt.3.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>John’s clothes were made of camels’ hair, with a leather strap around his waist, and his food was locusts and wild honey.</span>
<span class="verse Matt_3_5" data-osis="Matt.3.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>At that time Jerusalem, and all Judea, as well as the whole district of the Jordan, went out to him</span>
<span class="verse Matt_3_6" data-osis="Matt.3.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>and were baptized by him in the Jordan River, confessing their sins.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Matt_3_7" data-osis="Matt.3.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>But when John saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to receive his baptism, he said to them:</span>
</p>
<p>“You children of snakes! Who has prompted you to seek refuge from the coming judgment?
<span class="verse Matt_3_8" data-osis="Matt.3.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>Let your life, then, prove your repentance;</span>
<span class="verse Matt_3_9" data-osis="Matt.3.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>and do not think that you can say among yourselves ‘Abraham is our ancestor,’ for I tell you that out of these  stones God is able to raise descendants for Abraham!</span>
<span class="verse Matt_3_10" data-osis="Matt.3.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>Already the axe is lying at the root of the trees. Therefore every tree that fails to bear good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire.</span>
<span class="verse Matt_3_11" data-osis="Matt.3.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>I, indeed, baptize you with water to teach repentance; but he who is coming after me is more powerful than I, and I am not fit even to carry his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire.</span>
<span class="verse Matt_3_12" data-osis="Matt.3.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>His winnowing-fan is in his hand, and he will clear his threshing-floor, and store his grain in the barn, but the chaff he will burn with a fire that cannot be put out.”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Matt_3_13" data-osis="Matt.3.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan, to John, to be baptized by him.</span>
<span class="verse Matt_3_14" data-osis="Matt.3.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>But John tried to prevent him.</span>
</p>
<p>“I need to be baptized by you,” he said, “so why have you come to me?”
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Matt_3_15" data-osis="Matt.3.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">“This is the way it should be for now,” </span>Jesus answered, <span class="woc">“because we should do everything that God requires.” </span>So John agreed.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Matt_3_16" data-osis="Matt.3.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>After the baptism of Jesus, and just as he came up from the water, the heavens opened, and he saw the Spirit of God coming down like a dove and resting on him,</span>
<span class="verse Matt_3_17" data-osis="Matt.3.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>and from the heavens there came a voice which said: “This is my dearly loved son, who brings me great joy.”</span>

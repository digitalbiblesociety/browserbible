<span class="verse Matt_4_1" data-osis="Matt.4.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>Then Jesus was led up into the wilderness by the Spirit to be tempted by the devil.</span>
<span class="verse Matt_4_2" data-osis="Matt.4.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>And, after he had fasted for forty days and forty nights, he became hungry.</span>
<span class="verse Matt_4_3" data-osis="Matt.4.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>The Tempter came to him, and said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“If you are God’s Son, tell these stones to become loaves of bread.”<br /><br /></span>
<span class="verse Matt_4_4" data-osis="Matt.4.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>But Jesus answered: <span class="woc">“Scripture says —<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘It is not on bread alone that a person is to live, but on every word that comes from the mouth of God.’” </span><br /><br /></span>
<span class="verse Matt_4_5" data-osis="Matt.4.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>Then the devil took him to the Holy City, and, placing him on the parapet of the temple, said to him:</span>
<span class="verse Matt_4_6" data-osis="Matt.4.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>“If you are God’s Son, throw yourself down, for scripture says —<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘He will give his angels commands about you,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and on their hands they will lift you up,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so you do not even strike your foot against a stone.’”<br /><br /></span>
<span class="verse Matt_4_7" data-osis="Matt.4.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">“Scripture also says,” </span>answered Jesus, <span class="woc"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“You must not tempt the Lord your God.’” </span><br /><br /></span>
<span class="verse Matt_4_8" data-osis="Matt.4.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>The third time, the devil took Jesus to a very high mountain, and, showing him all the kingdoms of the world and their splendor, said to him:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
<span class="verse Matt_4_9" data-osis="Matt.4.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>“All these I will give you, if you will fall at my feet and worship me.”<br /><br /></span>
<span class="verse Matt_4_10" data-osis="Matt.4.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>Then Jesus said to him: <span class="woc">“Go away, Satan! For scripture says —<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘You must worship the Lord your God, and worship him only.’” </span><br /><br /></span>
<span class="verse Matt_4_11" data-osis="Matt.4.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>Then the devil left him alone, and angels came and helped him.</span>

<h4>The Work in Galilee</h4>
<span class="verse Matt_4_12" data-osis="Matt.4.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>When Jesus heard that John had been arrested, he returned to Galilee.</span>
<span class="verse Matt_4_13" data-osis="Matt.4.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>Afterwards, leaving Nazareth, he went and settled at Capernaum, which is by the side of the Sea, within the borders of Zebulun and Naphtali;</span>
<span class="verse Matt_4_14" data-osis="Matt.4.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>in fulfillment of these words in the prophet Isaiah —<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
<span class="verse Matt_4_15" data-osis="Matt.4.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>‘The land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the land of the Road by the Sea, and beyond the Jordan,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with Galilee of the Gentiles —<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
<span class="verse Matt_4_16" data-osis="Matt.4.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>The people who were living in darkness<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have seen a great light,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and, for those who were living in the shadow-land of death,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a light has dawned!’</span>
<span class="verse Matt_4_17" data-osis="Matt.4.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>At that time Jesus began to proclaim —<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="woc">“Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.” </span></span>
<p>
<span class="verse Matt_4_18" data-osis="Matt.4.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>As Jesus was walking along the shore of the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers — Simon, also known as Peter, and his brother Andrew — casting a net into the Sea; for they were fishermen.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Matt_4_19" data-osis="Matt.4.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">“Come and follow me,” </span>Jesus said, <span class="woc">“and I will teach you to fish for people.” </span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_4_20" data-osis="Matt.4.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>The two men left their nets at once and followed him.</span>
<span class="verse Matt_4_21" data-osis="Matt.4.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>Going further on, he saw two other men who were also brothers, James, Zebedee’s son, and his brother John, in their boat with their father, mending their nets. Jesus called them,</span>
<span class="verse Matt_4_22" data-osis="Matt.4.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>and they at once left their boat and their father, and followed him.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Matt_4_23" data-osis="Matt.4.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>Jesus went all through Galilee, teaching in their Synagogues, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom, and curing every kind of disease and every kind of sickness among the people;</span>
<span class="verse Matt_4_24" data-osis="Matt.4.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span>and his fame spread all through Syria. They brought to him all who were ill with any form of disease, or who were suffering pain — any who were either possessed by demons, or were lunatic, or paralyzed; and he cured them.</span>
<span class="verse Matt_4_25" data-osis="Matt.4.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span>He was followed by large crowds from Galilee, the district of the Ten Towns, Jerusalem, Judea, and from beyond the Jordan.</span>

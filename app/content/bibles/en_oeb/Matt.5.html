<span class="verse Matt_5_17" data-osis="Matt.5.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Do not think that I have come to do away with the law or the prophets; I have not come to do away with them, but to complete them.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_5_18" data-osis="Matt.5.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">For I tell you, until the heavens and the earth disappear, not even the smallest letter, nor one stroke of a letter, will disappear from the law until all is done.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_5_19" data-osis="Matt.5.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Whoever, therefore, breaks one of these commandments, even the least of them, and teaches others to do so, will be the least esteemed in the kingdom of heaven; but whoever keeps them, and teaches others to do so, will be esteemed great in the kingdom of heaven.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_5_20" data-osis="Matt.5.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Indeed I tell you that, unless you obey God's commands better than of the teachers of the law, and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.</span></span>

<p>
<span class="verse Matt_5_21" data-osis="Matt.5.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">You have heard that to our ancestors it was said — ‘You must not commit murder,’ and ‘Whoever commits murder will be brought to trial.’</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_5_22" data-osis="Matt.5.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">But I say to you that anyone who is angry at their brother or sister will be brought to trial; and whoever insults their brother or sister will be brought before the High Council, while whoever calls them a fool will be in danger of the fires of Gehenna.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_5_23" data-osis="Matt.5.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Therefore, when presenting your gift at the altar, if even there you remember that your brother or sister has something against you,</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_5_24" data-osis="Matt.5.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">leave your gift there, before the altar, go and be reconciled to them, first, then come and present your gift.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_5_25" data-osis="Matt.5.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Be ready to make friends with your opponent, even when you meet them on your way to the court; otherwise they might hand you over to the judge, and the judge to the judicial officer, and you will be thrown into prison.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_5_26" data-osis="Matt.5.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">I tell you, you will not come out until you have paid the last cent.</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Matt_5_27" data-osis="Matt.5.27"><span class="verse-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">You have heard that it was said — ‘You must not commit adultery.’</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_5_28" data-osis="Matt.5.28"><span class="verse-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">But I say to you that anyone who looks at a woman and desires her has already committed adultery with her in his heart.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_5_29" data-osis="Matt.5.29"><span class="verse-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">If your right eye causes you to sin, take it out and throw it away. It would be best for you to lose one part of your body, and not to have the whole of it thrown into Gehenna.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_5_30" data-osis="Matt.5.30"><span class="verse-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">And, if your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It would be best for you to lose one part of your body, and not to have the whole of it go down to Gehenna.</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Matt_5_31" data-osis="Matt.5.31"><span class="verse-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">It was also said — ‘Let anyone who divorces his wife serve her with a notice of separation.’</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_5_32" data-osis="Matt.5.32"><span class="verse-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">But I say to you that anyone who divorces his wife, except on the ground of some serious sexual sin, leads to her committing adultery; while anyone who marries her after her divorce is guilty of adultery.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_5_33" data-osis="Matt.5.33"><span class="verse-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Again, you have heard that our ancestors were told — ‘Do not break your oaths,  keep your vows to the Lord.’</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_5_34" data-osis="Matt.5.34"><span class="verse-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">But I say to you that you must not swear at all, either by heaven, since that is God’s throne,</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_5_35" data-osis="Matt.5.35"><span class="verse-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">or by the earth, since that is his footstool, or by Jerusalem, since that is the city of the Great King.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_5_36" data-osis="Matt.5.36"><span class="verse-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Nor should you swear by your head, since you cannot make a single hair either white or black.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_5_37" data-osis="Matt.5.37"><span class="verse-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Let your words be simply ‘Yes’ or ‘No’; anything beyond this comes from what is evil.</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Matt_5_38" data-osis="Matt.5.38"><span class="verse-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">You have heard that it was said — ‘An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.’</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_5_39" data-osis="Matt.5.39"><span class="verse-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">But I say to you that you must not resist those who wrong you; but, if anyone strikes you on the right cheek, turn the other to them also.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_5_40" data-osis="Matt.5.40"><span class="verse-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">If someone sues you for your shirt, let them have your cloak as well.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_5_41" data-osis="Matt.5.41"><span class="verse-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">If you are forced to carry a soldier's pack for one mile, carry it two.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_5_42" data-osis="Matt.5.42"><span class="verse-num v-42">42&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Give to anyone who asks and, if someone wants to borrow from you, do not turn them away.</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Matt_5_43" data-osis="Matt.5.43"><span class="verse-num v-43">43&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">You have heard that it was said — ‘You must love your neighbor and hate your enemy.’</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_5_44" data-osis="Matt.5.44"><span class="verse-num v-44">44&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">But what I tell you is this: love your enemies, and pray for those who persecute you,</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_5_45" data-osis="Matt.5.45"><span class="verse-num v-45">45&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">so that you may become children of your Father who is in heaven; for he causes his sun to rise on bad and good alike, and sends rain on the righteous and on the unrighteous.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_5_46" data-osis="Matt.5.46"><span class="verse-num v-46">46&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">For, if you love only those who love you, what reward will you have? Even the tax-gatherers do this!</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_5_47" data-osis="Matt.5.47"><span class="verse-num v-47">47&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">And, if you only welcome your brothers and sisters, what are you doing more than others? Even the Gentiles do this!</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_5_48" data-osis="Matt.5.48"><span class="verse-num v-48">48&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">You, then, must become perfect — as your heavenly Father is perfect.</span></span>

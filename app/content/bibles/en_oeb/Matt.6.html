<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.6.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Take care not to perform your religious duties in public in order to be seen by others; if you do, your Father who is in Heaven has no reward for you.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.6.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Therefore, when you do acts of charity, do not have a trumpet blown in front of you, as hypocrites do in the Synagogues and in the streets, that they may be praised by others. There, I tell you, is their reward!</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.6.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> But, when you do acts of charity, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing,</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.6.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> so that your charity may be secret; and your Father, who sees what is in secret, will recompense you.</span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.6.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> And, when you pray, you are not to behave as hypocrites do. They like to pray standing in the Synagogues and at the corners of the streets, that they may be seen by men. There, I tell you, is their reward!</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.6.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> But, when one of you prays, let him go into his own room, shut the door, and pray to his Father who dwells in secret; and his Father, who sees what is secret, will recompense him.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.6.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> When praying, do not repeat the same words over and over again, as is done by the Gentiles, who think that by using many words they will obtain a hearing.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.6.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Do not imitate them; for God, your Father, knows what you need before you ask him.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.6.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> You, therefore, should pray thus &mdash;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.6.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> thy Kingdom come, thy will be done &mdash;  </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.6.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Give us to-day </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.6.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> and forgive us our wrong-doings, </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.6.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> and take us not into temptation, </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.6.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> For, if you forgive others their offences, your heavenly Father will forgive you also;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.6.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> but, if you do not forgive others their offences, not even your Father will forgive your offences.</span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.6.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> And, when you fast, do not put on gloomy looks, as hypocrites do who disfigure their faces that they may be seen by men to be fasting. That, I tell you, is their reward!</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.6.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> But, when one of your fasts, let him anoint his head and wash his face,</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.6.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> that he may not be seen by men to be fasting, but by his Father who dwells in secret; and his Father, who sees what is secret, will recompense him.</span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.6.19"><span class="verse-num">19&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Do not store up treasures for yourselves on earth, where moth and rust destroy, and where thieves break in and steal.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.6.20"><span class="verse-num">20&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> But store up treasures for yourselves in Heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys, and where thieves do not break in or steal.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.6.21"><span class="verse-num">21&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.6.22"><span class="verse-num">22&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> The lamp of the body is the eye. If your eye is unclouded, your whole body will be lit up;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.6.23"><span class="verse-num">23&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> but, if your eye is diseased, your whole body will be darkened. And, if the inner light is darkness, how intense must that darkness be!</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.6.24"><span class="verse-num">24&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> No one can serve two masters, for either he will hate one and love the other, or else he will attach himself to one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and Money.</span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.6.25"><span class="verse-num">25&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> That is why I say to you, Do not be anxious about your life here &mdash; what you can get to eat or drink; nor yet about your body &mdash;  what you can get to wear. Is not life more than food, and the body than its clothing?</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.6.26"><span class="verse-num">26&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Look at the wild birds &mdash; they neither sow, nor reap, nor gather into barns; and yet your heavenly Father feeds them! And are not you more precious than they?</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.6.27"><span class="verse-num">27&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> But which of you, by being anxious, can prolong his life a single moment?</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.6.28"><span class="verse-num">28&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> And why be anxious about clothing? Study the wild lilies, and how they grow. They neither toil nor spin;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.6.29"><span class="verse-num">29&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> yet I tell you that even Solomon in all his splendour was not robed like one of these.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.6.30"><span class="verse-num">30&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> If God so clothes even the grass of the field, which is living to-day and to-morrow will be thrown into the oven, will not he much more clothe you, O men of little faith?</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.6.31"><span class="verse-num">31&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Do not then ask anxiously &lsquo;What can we get to eat?&rsquo; or &lsquo;What can we get to drink?&rsquo; or &lsquo;What can we get to wear?&rsquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.6.32"><span class="verse-num">32&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> All these are the things for which the nations are seeking, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them all.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.6.33"><span class="verse-num">33&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> But first seek his Kingdom and the righteousness that he requires, and then all these things shall be added for you.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.6.34"><span class="verse-num">34&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Therefore do not be anxious about to-morrow, for to-morrow will bring its own anxieties. Every day has trouble enough of its own.</span></span>

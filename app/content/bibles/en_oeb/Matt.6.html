<span class="verse Matt_6_1" data-osis="Matt.6.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Take care not to perform your religious duties in public in order to be seen by others; if you do, your Father who is in heaven has no reward for you.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_6_2" data-osis="Matt.6.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Therefore, when you do acts of charity, do not have a trumpet blown in front of you, as hypocrites do in the Synagogues and in the streets so that people will praise them. There, I tell you, is their reward!</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_6_3" data-osis="Matt.6.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">But, when you do acts of charity, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing,</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_6_4" data-osis="Matt.6.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">so that your charity may be secret; and your Father, who sees what is in secret, will reward you.</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Matt_6_5" data-osis="Matt.6.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">And, when you pray, you are not to behave as hypocrites do. They like to pray standing in the Synagogues and at the corners of the streets, so that people will see them. There, I tell you, is their reward!</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_6_6" data-osis="Matt.6.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">But, when one of you prays, let them go into their own room, shut the door, and pray to their Father who dwells in secret; and their Father, who sees what is secret, will reward them.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_6_7" data-osis="Matt.6.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">When praying, do not repeat the same words over and over again, as is done by the Gentiles, who think that by using many words they will obtain a hearing.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_6_8" data-osis="Matt.6.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Do not imitate them; for God, your Father, knows what you need before you ask him.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_6_9" data-osis="Matt.6.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">You, therefore, should pray like this —<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="woc">‘Our Father, who is in heaven,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="woc">may your name be held holy,</span><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
<span class="verse Matt_6_10" data-osis="Matt.6.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">your kingdom come, your will be done —  </span><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="woc">on earth, as in heaven.</span><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
<span class="verse Matt_6_11" data-osis="Matt.6.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Give us today </span><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="woc">the bread that we will need;</span><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
<span class="verse Matt_6_12" data-osis="Matt.6.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">and forgive us our wrong-doings, </span><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="woc">as we have forgiven those who have wronged us;</span><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
<span class="verse Matt_6_13" data-osis="Matt.6.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">and take us not into temptation, </span><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="woc">but deliver us from evil.’</span><br /><br /></span>
<span class="verse Matt_6_14" data-osis="Matt.6.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">For, if you forgive others their offenses, your heavenly Father will forgive you also;</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_6_15" data-osis="Matt.6.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">but, if you do not forgive others their offenses, not even your Father will forgive your offenses.</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Matt_6_16" data-osis="Matt.6.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">And, when you fast, do not put on gloomy looks, as hypocrites do who disfigure their faces so that they may be seen by people to be fasting. That, I tell you, is their reward!</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_6_17" data-osis="Matt.6.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">But, when one of you fasts, let them anoint their head and wash their face,</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_6_18" data-osis="Matt.6.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">so that they may not be seen by people to be fasting, but by their Father who dwells in secret; and their Father, who sees what is secret, will reward them.</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Matt_6_19" data-osis="Matt.6.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Do not store up treasures for yourselves on earth, where moth and rust destroy, and where thieves break in and steal.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_6_20" data-osis="Matt.6.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">But store up treasures for yourselves in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys, and where thieves do not break in or steal.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_6_21" data-osis="Matt.6.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_6_22" data-osis="Matt.6.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">The lamp of the body is the eye. If your eye is unclouded, your whole body will be lit up;</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_6_23" data-osis="Matt.6.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">but, if your eye is diseased, your whole body will be darkened. And, if the inner light is darkness, how intense must that darkness be!</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_6_24" data-osis="Matt.6.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">No one can serve two masters, for either they will hate one and love the other, or else they will attach themselves to one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and Money.</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Matt_6_25" data-osis="Matt.6.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">This is why I say to you: Do not be anxious about your life — what you can get to eat or drink, or about your body — what you can get to wear. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothing?</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_6_26" data-osis="Matt.6.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Look at the wild birds — they neither sow, nor reap, nor gather into barns; and yet your heavenly Father feeds them! Aren’t you more precious than they?</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_6_27" data-osis="Matt.6.27"><span class="verse-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">But which of you, by being anxious, can prolong their life a single moment?</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_6_28" data-osis="Matt.6.28"><span class="verse-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">And why be anxious about clothing? Study the wild lilies, and how they grow. They neither toil nor spin;</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_6_29" data-osis="Matt.6.29"><span class="verse-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">yet I tell you that even Solomon in all his splendor was not robed like one of these.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_6_30" data-osis="Matt.6.30"><span class="verse-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">If God so clothes even the grass of the field, which is living today and tomorrow will be thrown into the oven, will not he much more clothe you, you of little faith?</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_6_31" data-osis="Matt.6.31"><span class="verse-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Do not then ask anxiously ‘What can we get to eat?’ or ‘What can we get to drink?’ or ‘What can we get to wear?’</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_6_32" data-osis="Matt.6.32"><span class="verse-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">All these are the things for which the nations are seeking, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them all.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_6_33" data-osis="Matt.6.33"><span class="verse-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">But first seek his kingdom and the righteousness that he requires, and then all these things will be added for you.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_6_34" data-osis="Matt.6.34"><span class="verse-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Therefore do not be anxious about tomorrow, for tomorrow will bring its own anxieties. Every day has trouble enough of its own.</span></span>

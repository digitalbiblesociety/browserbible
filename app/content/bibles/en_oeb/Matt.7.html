<span class="verse Matt_7_16" data-osis="Matt.7.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">By the fruit of their lives you will know them. Do people pick grapes from thorn bushes, or figs from thistles?</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_7_17" data-osis="Matt.7.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">So, too, every sound tree bears good fruit, while a worthless tree bears bad fruit.</span></span>

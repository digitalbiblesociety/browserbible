<h2 class="chapter-num">8</h2>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.8.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>When Jesus had come down from the hill, great crowds followed him.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.8.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>And he saw a leper who came up, and bowed to the ground before him, and said: &ldquo;Master, if only you are willing, you are able to make me clean.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.8.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>Stretching out his hand, Jesus touched him, saying as he did so: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;I am willing; become clean.&rdquo; </span>  Instantly he was made clean from his leprosy;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.8.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>and then Jesus said to him: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Be careful not to say a word to any one, but go and show yourself to the Priest, and offer the gift directed by Moses, as evidence of your cure.&rdquo; </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.8.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>After Jesus had entered Capernaum, a Captain in the Roman army came up to him, entreating his help.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.8.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;my manservant is lying ill at my house with a stroke of paralysis, and is suffering terribly.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.8.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;I will come and cure him,&rdquo; </span>  answered Jesus.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.8.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; the Captain went on, &ldquo;I am unworthy to receive you under my roof; but only speak, and my manservant will be cured.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.8.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>For I myself am a man under the orders of others, with soldiers under me; and, if I say to one of them &lsquo;Go,&rsquo; he goes, and to another &lsquo;Come,&rsquo; he comes, and to my slave &lsquo;Do this,&rsquo; he does it.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.8.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>Jesus was surprised to hear this, and said to those who were following him: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Never I tell you, in any Israelite have I met with such faith as this!</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.8.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Yes, and many will come in from East and West and take their places beside Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, in the Kingdom of Heaven;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.8.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> while the heirs to the Kingdom will be &lsquo;banished into the darkness&rsquo; outside; there, there will be weeping and grinding of teeth.&rdquo; </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.8.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>Then Jesus said to the Captain: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Go now, and it shall be according to your faith.&rdquo; </span>  And the man was cured that very hour.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.8.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>When Jesus went into Peter&rsquo;s house, he saw Peter&rsquo;s mother-in- law prostrated with fever.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.8.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>On his taking her hand, the fever left her, and she rose and began to wait upon him.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.8.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span>In the evening the people brought to Jesus many who were possessed by demons; and he drove out the spirits with a word, and cured all who were ill,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.8.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span>in fulfilment of these words in the Prophet Isaiah &mdash; &lsquo;He took our infirmities on himself, and bore the burden of our diseases.&rsquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.8.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span>Seeing a crowd round him, Jesus gave orders to go across.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.8.19"><span class="verse-num">19&nbsp;</span>And a Teacher of the Law came up to him, and said: &ldquo;Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.8.20"><span class="verse-num">20&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;Foxes have holes,&rdquo; </span>  answered Jesus, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;and wild birds their roosting-places, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head.&rdquo; </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.8.21"><span class="verse-num">21&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Master,&rdquo; said another, who was a disciple, &ldquo;let me first go and bury my father.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.8.22"><span class="verse-num">22&nbsp;</span>But Jesus answered: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Follow me, and leave the dead to bury their dead.&rdquo; </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.8.23"><span class="verse-num">23&nbsp;</span>Then he got into the boat, followed by his disciples.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.8.24"><span class="verse-num">24&nbsp;</span>Suddenly so great a storm came on upon the Sea, that the waves broke right over the boat. But Jesus was asleep;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.8.25"><span class="verse-num">25&nbsp;</span>and the disciples came and roused him. &ldquo;Master,&rdquo; they cried, &ldquo;save us; we are lost!&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.8.26"><span class="verse-num">26&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;Why are you so timid?&rdquo; </span>  he said. <span class="woc"> &ldquo;O men of little faith!&rdquo; </span>  Then Jesus rose and rebuked the winds and the sea, and a great calm followed.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.8.27"><span class="verse-num">27&nbsp;</span>The men were amazed, and exclaimed: &ldquo;What kind of man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey him!&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.8.28"><span class="verse-num">28&nbsp;</span>And on getting to the other side &mdash; the country of the Gadarenes &mdash; Jesus met two men who were possessed by demons, coming out of the tombs. They were so violent that no one was able to pass that way.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.8.29"><span class="verse-num">29&nbsp;</span>Suddenly they shrieked out: &ldquo;What do you want with us, Son of God? Have you come here to torment us before our time?&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.8.30"><span class="verse-num">30&nbsp;</span>A long way off, there was a drove of many pigs, feeding;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.8.31"><span class="verse-num">31&nbsp;</span>and the foul spirits began begging Jesus: &ldquo;If you drive us out, send us into the drove of pigs.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.8.32"><span class="verse-num">32&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;Go,&rdquo; </span>  he said. The spirits came out, and entered the pigs; and the whole drove rushed down the steep slope into the Sea, and died in the water.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.8.33"><span class="verse-num">33&nbsp;</span>At this the men who tended them ran away and went to the town, carrying the news of all that had occurred, and of what had happened to the possessed men.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.8.34"><span class="verse-num">34&nbsp;</span>At the news the whole town went out to meet Jesus, and, when they saw him, they entreated him to go away from their neighbourhood.</span>

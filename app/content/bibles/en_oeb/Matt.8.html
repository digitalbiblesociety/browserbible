<h2 class="chapter-num">8</h2>
<p>
<span class="verse Matt_8_1" data-osis="Matt.8.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>When Jesus had come down from the hill, great crowds followed him.</span>
<span class="verse Matt_8_2" data-osis="Matt.8.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>He saw a leper who came up, and bowed to the ground before him, and said: “Master, if only you are willing, you are able to make me clean.”</span>
<span class="verse Matt_8_3" data-osis="Matt.8.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>Stretching out his hand, Jesus touched him, saying as he did so: <span class="woc">“I am willing; become clean.” </span>Instantly he was made clean from his leprosy;</span>
<span class="verse Matt_8_4" data-osis="Matt.8.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>and then Jesus said to him: <span class="woc">“Be careful not to say a word to anyone, but go and show yourself to the priest, and offer the gift directed by Moses, as evidence of your cure.” </span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_8_5" data-osis="Matt.8.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>After Jesus had entered Capernaum, a captain in the Roman army came up to him, entreating his help.</span>
<span class="verse Matt_8_6" data-osis="Matt.8.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>“Sir,” he said, “my manservant is lying ill at my house with a stroke of paralysis, and is suffering terribly.”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Matt_8_7" data-osis="Matt.8.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">“I will come and cure him,” </span>answered Jesus.</span>
<span class="verse Matt_8_8" data-osis="Matt.8.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>“Sir,” the captain went on, “I am unworthy to receive you under my roof; but only speak, and my manservant will be cured.</span>
<span class="verse Matt_8_9" data-osis="Matt.8.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>For I myself am a man under the orders of others, with soldiers under me; and, if I say to one of them ‘Go,’ he goes, and to another ‘Come,’ he comes, and to my slave ‘Do this,’ he does it.”</span>
<span class="verse Matt_8_10" data-osis="Matt.8.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>Jesus was surprised to hear this, and said to those who were following him: <span class="woc">“Never I tell you, in any Israelite have I met with such faith as this!</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_8_11" data-osis="Matt.8.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Yes, and many will come in from East and West and take their places beside Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven;</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_8_12" data-osis="Matt.8.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">while the heirs to the kingdom will be ‘banished into the darkness’ outside; there, there will be weeping and grinding of teeth.” </span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_8_13" data-osis="Matt.8.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>Then Jesus said to the captain: <span class="woc">“Go now, and it will be according to your faith.” </span>And the man was cured that very hour.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Matt_8_14" data-osis="Matt.8.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>When Jesus went into Peter’s house, he saw Peter’s mother-in-law prostrated with fever.</span>
<span class="verse Matt_8_15" data-osis="Matt.8.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>On his taking her hand, the fever left her, and she rose and began to take care of him.</span>
<span class="verse Matt_8_16" data-osis="Matt.8.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>In the evening the people brought to Jesus many who were possessed by demons; and he drove out the spirits with a word, and cured all who were ill,</span>
<span class="verse Matt_8_17" data-osis="Matt.8.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>in fulfillment of these words in the prophet Isaiah — ‘He took our infirmities on himself, and bore the burden of our diseases.’</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Matt_8_18" data-osis="Matt.8.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>Seeing a crowd around him, Jesus gave orders to go across.</span>
<span class="verse Matt_8_19" data-osis="Matt.8.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>A teacher of the law came up to him, and said: “Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go.”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Matt_8_20" data-osis="Matt.8.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">“Foxes have holes,” </span>answered Jesus, <span class="woc">“and wild birds their nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head.” </span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_8_21" data-osis="Matt.8.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>“Master,” said another, who was a disciple, “let me first go and bury my father.”</span>
<span class="verse Matt_8_22" data-osis="Matt.8.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>But Jesus answered: <span class="woc">“Follow me, and leave the dead to bury their dead.” </span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_8_23" data-osis="Matt.8.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>Then he got into the boat, followed by his disciples.</span>
<span class="verse Matt_8_24" data-osis="Matt.8.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span>Suddenly so great a storm came up on the Sea, that the waves broke right over the boat. But Jesus was asleep;</span>
<span class="verse Matt_8_25" data-osis="Matt.8.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span>and the disciples came and roused him. “Master,” they cried, “save us; we are lost!”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Matt_8_26" data-osis="Matt.8.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">“Why are you so timid?” </span>he said. <span class="woc">“You of little faith!” </span>Then Jesus rose and rebuked the winds and the sea, and a great calm followed.</span>
<span class="verse Matt_8_27" data-osis="Matt.8.27"><span class="verse-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span>The men were amazed, and exclaimed: “What kind of man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey him!”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Matt_8_28" data-osis="Matt.8.28"><span class="verse-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span>On getting to the other side — the country of the Gadarenes — Jesus met two men who were possessed by demons, coming out of the tombs. They were so violent that no one was able to pass that way.</span>
<span class="verse Matt_8_29" data-osis="Matt.8.29"><span class="verse-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span>Suddenly they shrieked out: “What do you want with us, Son of God? Have you come here to torment us before our time?”</span>
<span class="verse Matt_8_30" data-osis="Matt.8.30"><span class="verse-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span>A long way off, there was a drove of many pigs, feeding;</span>
<span class="verse Matt_8_31" data-osis="Matt.8.31"><span class="verse-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span>and the foul spirits began begging Jesus: “If you drive us out, send us into the drove of pigs.”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Matt_8_32" data-osis="Matt.8.32"><span class="verse-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">“Go,” </span>he said. The spirits came out, and entered the pigs; and the whole drove rushed down the steep slope into the Sea, and died in the water.</span>
<span class="verse Matt_8_33" data-osis="Matt.8.33"><span class="verse-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span>At this the men who tended them ran away and went to the town, carrying the news of all that had occurred, and of what had happened to the possessed men.</span>
<span class="verse Matt_8_34" data-osis="Matt.8.34"><span class="verse-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span>At the news the whole town went out to meet Jesus, and, when they saw him, they entreated him to go away from their neighborhood.</span>

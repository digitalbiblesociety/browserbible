<h3>Paul’s Letter to the</h3>
<h3>Philippians</h3>
<h2 class="chapter-num">1</h2>
<p>
<span class="verse Phil_1_1" data-osis="Phil.1.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>To all Christ’s people at Philippi, with the presiding officers and assistants, from Paul and Timothy, servants of Christ Jesus.</span>
<span class="verse Phil_1_2" data-osis="Phil.1.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>May God, our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ bless you, and give you peace.</span>
<span class="verse Phil_1_3" data-osis="Phil.1.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>Every recollection that I have of you is a cause of thankfulness to God,</span>
<span class="verse Phil_1_4" data-osis="Phil.1.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>always, in every prayer that I offer for you all — my prayers are full of joy —</span>
<span class="verse Phil_1_5" data-osis="Phil.1.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>Because of the share that you have had in spreading the good news, from the first day that you received it until now.</span>
<span class="verse Phil_1_6" data-osis="Phil.1.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>For of this I am confident, that he who began a good work in you will complete it in readiness for the day of Jesus Christ.</span>
<span class="verse Phil_1_7" data-osis="Phil.1.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>And, indeed, I am justified in feeling like this about you all; because you have a warm place in my heart — you who all, both in my imprisonment and in the work of defending and establishing the good news, shared my privilege with me.</span>
<span class="verse Phil_1_8" data-osis="Phil.1.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>God will bear me witness how I yearn over you all with the tenderness of Christ Jesus.</span>
<span class="verse Phil_1_9" data-osis="Phil.1.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>And what I pray for is this — that your love may grow yet stronger and stronger, with increasing knowledge and all discernment,</span>
<span class="verse Phil_1_10" data-osis="Phil.1.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>until you are able to appreciate all moral distinctions. And I pray, too, that you may be kept pure and blameless against the day of Christ,</span>
<span class="verse Phil_1_11" data-osis="Phil.1.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>bearing a rich harvest of that righteousness which comes through Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Phil_1_12" data-osis="Phil.1.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>Friends, I want you to realize that what has happened to me has actually served to forward the good news.</span>
<span class="verse Phil_1_13" data-osis="Phil.1.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>It has even become evident, not only to all the imperial guard, but to everyone else, that it is for Christ’s sake that I am in chains.</span>
<span class="verse Phil_1_14" data-osis="Phil.1.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>And besides this, most of our fellow followers have gained confidence in the Lord through my chains, and now venture with far greater freedom to speak of God’s message fearlessly.</span>
<span class="verse Phil_1_15" data-osis="Phil.1.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>It is true that some do proclaim the Christ out of Jealousy and opposition; but there are others who proclaim him from goodwill.</span>
<span class="verse Phil_1_16" data-osis="Phil.1.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>The latter do it from love for me, knowing that I have been appointed to plead the cause of the good news.</span>
<span class="verse Phil_1_17" data-osis="Phil.1.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>The former spread the news of the Christ in a factious spirit, and not sincerely, thinking to add to the pain of my chains.</span>
<span class="verse Phil_1_18" data-osis="Phil.1.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>But what of that? Only that in some way or other, either with assumed or with real earnestness, Christ is being made known; and at that I rejoice.</span>
<span class="verse Phil_1_19" data-osis="Phil.1.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>Yes, and I will rejoice, for I know that, through your prayers and through a rich supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, ‘all this will make for my salvation.’</span>
<span class="verse Phil_1_20" data-osis="Phil.1.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>And this will fulfill my earnest expectation and hope that I will have no cause for shame, but that, with unfailing courage, now as hitherto, Christ will be honored in my body, whether by my life or by my death,</span>
<span class="verse Phil_1_21" data-osis="Phil.1.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>for to me life is Christ, and death is gain.</span>
<span class="verse Phil_1_22" data-osis="Phil.1.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>But what if the life here in the body — if this brings me fruit from my labors? Then which to choose I cannot tell! I am sorely perplexed either way!</span>
<span class="verse Phil_1_23" data-osis="Phil.1.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>My own desire is to depart and be with Christ, for this would be far better.</span>
<span class="verse Phil_1_24" data-osis="Phil.1.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span>But, for your sakes, it may be more needful that I should still remain here in the body.</span>
<span class="verse Phil_1_25" data-osis="Phil.1.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span>Yes, I am confident that this is so, and therefore I am sure that I will stay, and stay near you all, to promote your progress and joy in the faith;</span>
<span class="verse Phil_1_26" data-osis="Phil.1.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span>so that, when you once more have me among you, you, in your union with Christ Jesus, may find in me fresh cause for exultation.</span>
<span class="verse Phil_1_27" data-osis="Phil.1.27"><span class="verse-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span>Under all circumstances let your lives be worthy of the good news of the Christ: so that, whether I come and see you, or whether I hear of your affairs at a distance, I may know that you are standing firm, animated by one spirit, and joining with one heart in a common struggle for the faith taught by the good news,</span>
<span class="verse Phil_1_28" data-osis="Phil.1.28"><span class="verse-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span>without ever shrinking from your opponents. To them this will be a sign of their destruction and of your salvation — a sign from God.</span>
<span class="verse Phil_1_29" data-osis="Phil.1.29"><span class="verse-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span>For, on behalf of Christ, you have had the privilege granted you, not only of trusting in him, but also of suffering on his behalf.</span>
<span class="verse Phil_1_30" data-osis="Phil.1.30"><span class="verse-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span>You will be engaged in the same hard struggle as that which you once saw me waging, and which you hear that I am waging still.</span>

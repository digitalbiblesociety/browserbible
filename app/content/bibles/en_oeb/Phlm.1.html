<h4>Introduction</h4>
<span class="verse Phlm_1_1" data-osis="Phlm.1.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>From Paul, now a prisoner for Christ Jesus, and from Timothy, a fellow follower of the Lord.</span>
<span class="verse Phlm_1_2" data-osis="Phlm.1.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>To our dear friend and fellow worker Philemon, to our sister Apphia, to our fellow soldier Archippus; and to the church that meets at Philemon’s house;</span>
<span class="verse Phlm_1_3" data-osis="Phlm.1.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>may God, our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ bless you and give you peace.</span>
<h4>Request regarding runaway slave</h4>
<span class="verse Phlm_1_4" data-osis="Phlm.1.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>I always mention you in my prayers and thank God for you,</span>
<span class="verse Phlm_1_5" data-osis="Phlm.1.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>because I hear of the love and the faith which you show, not only to the Lord Jesus, but also to all his people;</span>
<span class="verse Phlm_1_6" data-osis="Phlm.1.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>and I pray that your participation in the faith may result in action, as you come to a fuller realization of everything that is good and Christlike in us.</span>
<span class="verse Phlm_1_7" data-osis="Phlm.1.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>I have indeed found great joy and encouragement in your love, knowing, as I do, how the hearts of Christ’s People have been cheered, friend, by you.</span>
<p>
<span class="verse Phlm_1_8" data-osis="Phlm.1.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>And so, though my union with Christ enables me, with all confidence, to dictate the course that you should adopt,</span>
<span class="verse Phlm_1_9" data-osis="Phlm.1.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>yet the claims of love make me prefer to plead with you — yes, even me, Paul, though I am an ambassador for Christ Jesus and, now a prisoner for him as well.</span>
<span class="verse Phlm_1_10" data-osis="Phlm.1.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>I plead with you for this child of mine, Onesimus, to whom, in my prison, I have become a father.</span>
<span class="verse Phlm_1_11" data-osis="Phlm.1.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>Once he was of little service to you, but now he has become of great service, not only to you, but to me as well;</span>
<span class="verse Phlm_1_12" data-osis="Phlm.1.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>and I am sending him back to you with this letter — though it is like tearing out of my  heart.</span>
<span class="verse Phlm_1_13" data-osis="Phlm.1.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>For my own sake I should like to keep him with me, so that, while I am in prison for the good news, he might attend to my wants on your behalf.</span>
<span class="verse Phlm_1_14" data-osis="Phlm.1.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>But I do not wish to do anything without your consent, because I want your generosity to be voluntary and not, as it were, compulsory.</span>
<span class="verse Phlm_1_15" data-osis="Phlm.1.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>It may be that he was separated from you for an hour, for this  reason, so that you might have him back for ever,</span>
<span class="verse Phlm_1_16" data-osis="Phlm.1.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>no longer as a slave, but as something better — a dearly loved friend and follower of the Lord, especially dear to me, and how much more so to you, not only as a person, but as your fellow Christian!</span>
<span class="verse Phlm_1_17" data-osis="Phlm.1.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>If, then, you count me your friend, receive him as you would me.</span>
<span class="verse Phlm_1_18" data-osis="Phlm.1.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>If he has caused you any loss, or owes you anything, charge it to me.</span>
<span class="verse Phlm_1_19" data-osis="Phlm.1.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>I, Paul, put my own hand to it — I will repay you myself. I say nothing about your owing me your  self.</span>
<span class="verse Phlm_1_20" data-osis="Phlm.1.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>Yes, friend, let me gain something from you because of your union with the Lord. Cheer my heart by your Christlike spirit.</span>
<span class="verse Phlm_1_21" data-osis="Phlm.1.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>Even as I write, I have such confidence in your compliance with my wishes, that I am sure that you will do even more than I am asking.</span>
<span class="verse Phlm_1_22" data-osis="Phlm.1.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>Please also get a lodging ready for me, for I hope that I will be given back to you all in answer to your prayers.</span>
</p>

<span class="verse Phlm_1_23" data-osis="Phlm.1.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>Epaphras, who is my fellow prisoner for Christ Jesus, sends you his greeting;</span>
<span class="verse Phlm_1_24" data-osis="Phlm.1.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span>and Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my fellow workers, send theirs.</span>

<h4>Messages to the Seven Churches</h4>
<span class="verse Rev_1_4" data-osis="Rev.1.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>From John, to the seven churches which are in Roman Asia. Blessing and peace be yours from him who is, and who was, and who will be, and from the seven spirits that are before his throne,</span>
<span class="verse Rev_1_5" data-osis="Rev.1.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>and from Jesus Christ, ‘the faithful witness, the first-born from the dead, and the Ruler of all the kings of the earth.’ To him who loves us and freed us from our sins by his own blood —</span>
<span class="verse Rev_1_6" data-osis="Rev.1.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>and he made us ‘a kingdom of priests in the service of God,’ his Father!  — to Him be ascribed glory and dominion for ever. Amen.</span>
<span class="verse Rev_1_7" data-osis="Rev.1.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>‘He is coming among the clouds!’ Every eye will see him, even those who pierced him; ‘and all the nations of the earth will mourn over him.’ So will it be. Amen.</span>
<span class="verse Rev_1_8" data-osis="Rev.1.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">‘I am the Alpha and the Omega,’</span>says the Lord, <span class="woc">the God who is, and who was, and who will be, the Almighty.</span></span>
<span class="verse Rev_1_9" data-osis="Rev.1.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>I, John, who am your brother, and who share with you in the suffering and kingship and endurance of Jesus, found myself on the island called Patmos, for the sake of the message of God and the testimony to Jesus.</span>
<span class="verse Rev_1_10" data-osis="Rev.1.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>I fell into a trance on the Lord’s day, and I heard behind me a loud voice, like the blast of a trumpet.</span>
<span class="verse Rev_1_11" data-osis="Rev.1.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>It said —  <span class="woc">‘Write what you see in a book and send it to the seven churches, to Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamus, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodicaea.’</span></span>
<span class="verse Rev_1_12" data-osis="Rev.1.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>I turned to see what voice it was that spoke to me; and when I turned, I saw seven golden lamps,</span>
<span class="verse Rev_1_13" data-osis="Rev.1.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>and in the midst of the lamps one ‘like a man, in a robe reaching to his feet,’ and with a golden sash across his breast.</span>
<span class="verse Rev_1_14" data-osis="Rev.1.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>‘The hair of his head was as white as wool, as white as snow; his eyes were like flaming fire;</span>
<span class="verse Rev_1_15" data-osis="Rev.1.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>and his feet were like brass’ as when molten in a furnace; ‘his voice was like the sound of many streams,’</span>
<span class="verse Rev_1_16" data-osis="Rev.1.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>in his right hand he held seven stars, from his mouth came a sharp two-edged sword, and his face was like ‘the sun in the fulness of its power.’</span>
<span class="verse Rev_1_17" data-osis="Rev.1.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>And, when I saw him, I fell at his feet like one dead. He laid his hand on me and said —  <span class="woc">‘Do not be afraid. I am the First and the Last,</span></span>
<span class="verse Rev_1_18" data-osis="Rev.1.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">the Everliving. I died, and I am alive for ever and ever. And I hold the keys of the Grave and of the place of the dead.</span></span>
<span class="verse Rev_1_19" data-osis="Rev.1.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Therefore write of what you have seen and of what is happening now and of what is about to take place — </span></span>
<span class="verse Rev_1_20" data-osis="Rev.1.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">the mystic meaning of the seven stars which you saw in my right hand, and the seven golden lamps. The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches, and the seven lamps are the seven churches.</span></span>

<h4>Vision of Seven Curses</h4>
<span class="verse Rev_15_1" data-osis="Rev.15.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>Then I saw another portent in the heavens — a great and marvelous portent — seven angels with the seven last curses; because with them the wrath of God is ended.</span>
<p>
<span class="verse Rev_15_2" data-osis="Rev.15.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>Then I saw what appeared to be a sea of glass mixed with fire; and, standing by this sea of glass, holding the harps of God, I saw those who had come victorious out of the conflict with the Beast and its image and the number that formed its name.</span>
<span class="verse Rev_15_3" data-osis="Rev.15.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>They are singing the song of Moses, the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb —<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘Great and marvelous are your deeds, Lord, our God, the Almighty. Righteous and true are your ways, eternal King.</span>
<span class="verse Rev_15_4" data-osis="Rev.15.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>Who will not honor and praise your name, Lord? You alone are holy! All nations will come and worship before you, for your judgments have become manifest.’<br /><br /></span>
<span class="verse Rev_15_5" data-osis="Rev.15.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>After this I saw that the inmost shrine of the tent of testimony in heaven was opened,</span>
<span class="verse Rev_15_6" data-osis="Rev.15.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>and out of it came the seven angels with the seven curses. They were adorned with precious stones, pure and bright, and had golden girdles around their breasts.</span>
<span class="verse Rev_15_7" data-osis="Rev.15.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>One of the four Creatures gave the seven angels seven golden bowls, filled with the wrath of God who lives for ever and ever.</span>
<span class="verse Rev_15_8" data-osis="Rev.15.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>‘The Temple was filled with smoke from the glory’ and Majesty of God; and no one could enter the Temple, until the seven curses inflicted by the seven angels were at an end.</span>

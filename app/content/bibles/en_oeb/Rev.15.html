<span class="verse" data-osis="Rev.15.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>Then I saw another portent in the heavens &mdash; a great and marvellous portent &mdash; seven angels with the seven last Curses; because with them the Wrath of God is ended.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rev.15.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>Then I saw what appeared to be a sea of glass mixed with fire; and, standing by this sea of glass, holding the harps of God, I saw those who had come victorious out of the conflict with the Beast and its image and the number that formed its name.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rev.15.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>They are singing the song of Moses, the Servant of God, and the song of the Lamb &mdash;  &lsquo;Great and marvellous are thy deeds, O Lord, our God, the Almighty. Righteous and true are thy ways, Eternal King.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rev.15.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>Who will not reverence and praise thy Name, O Lord? Thou alone art holy! All nations will come and worship before thee, for thy judgments have become manifest.&rsquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rev.15.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>After this I saw that the inmost shrine of the Tabernacle of Revelation in Heaven was opened,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rev.15.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>and out of it came the seven angels with the seven Curses. They were adorned with precious stones, pure and bright, and had golden girdles round their breasts.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rev.15.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>One of the four Creatures gave the seven angels seven golden bowls, filled with the Wrath of God who lives for ever and ever.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rev.15.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>&lsquo;The Temple was filled with smoke from the Glory&rsquo; and Majesty of God; and no one could enter the Temple, until the seven Curses inflicted by the seven angels were at an end.</span>

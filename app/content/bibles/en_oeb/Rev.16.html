<h2 class="chapter-num">16</h2>
<p>
<span class="verse Rev_16_1" data-osis="Rev.16.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>Then I heard a loud voice, which came from the Temple, saying to the seven angels —  ‘Go and empty the seven bowls of the wrath of God on the earth.’</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Rev_16_2" data-osis="Rev.16.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>The first angel went and emptied his bowl on the earth; and it turned to loathsome and painful sores on all who bore the brand of the Beast and who worshiped its image.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Rev_16_3" data-osis="Rev.16.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>Then the second angel emptied his bowl on the sea; and it turned to blood like the blood of a corpse, and every living thing died — everything in the sea.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Rev_16_4" data-osis="Rev.16.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>Then the third angel emptied his bowl on the rivers and springs of water; and it turned to blood.</span>
<span class="verse Rev_16_5" data-osis="Rev.16.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>And I heard the angel of the Waters saying —  ‘Righteous are you, you who is and who is, the Holy One, in inflicting this judgment;</span>
<span class="verse Rev_16_6" data-osis="Rev.16.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>for men shed the blood of Christ’s people and of the prophets, and you have given them blood to drink. It is what they deserve.’</span>
<span class="verse Rev_16_7" data-osis="Rev.16.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>And I heard the response from the altar —  ‘Yes, Lord, our God, the Almighty, true and righteous are they judgments.’</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Rev_16_8" data-osis="Rev.16.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>Then the fourth angel emptied his bowl on the sun; and he was permitted to scorch men with fire;</span>
<span class="verse Rev_16_9" data-osis="Rev.16.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>and men were scorched by the intense heat. They blasphemed the name of God who controlled these curses, yet they did not repent and give him praise.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Rev_16_10" data-osis="Rev.16.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>Then the fifth angel emptied his bowl on the throne of the Beast; and darkness fell on its kingdom. Men gnawed their tongues for pain,</span>
<span class="verse Rev_16_11" data-osis="Rev.16.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>and blasphemed the God of heaven, because of their pains and because of their sores; yet they did not repent of what they had done.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Rev_16_12" data-osis="Rev.16.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>Then the sixth angel emptied his bowl on the great river Euphrates; and the water in the river was dried up, so that the road for the kings of the East might be made ready.</span>
<span class="verse Rev_16_13" data-osis="Rev.16.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>And I saw three foul spirits, like frogs, come from the mouth of the Dragon and from the mouth of the Beast and from the mouth of the false prophet.</span>
<span class="verse Rev_16_14" data-osis="Rev.16.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>They are the spirits of demons, and perform marvels; they go to kings all over the world, to collect them for the battle on the great day of Almighty God.</span>
<span class="verse Rev_16_15" data-osis="Rev.16.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">(‘I am coming like a thief! Happy will he be who is on the watch, and keeps his clothing at hand, so that he will not have to walk about unclothed and let men see his nakedness.’)</span></span>
<span class="verse Rev_16_16" data-osis="Rev.16.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>And the spirits collected the kings at the place called in Hebrew ‘Har-Magedon.’</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Rev_16_17" data-osis="Rev.16.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>Then the seventh angel emptied his bowl on the air. (A loud voice came from the throne in the Temple; it said ‘All is over.’)</span>
<span class="verse Rev_16_18" data-osis="Rev.16.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>There followed ‘flashes of lightning, cries, and peals of thunder’; and there was a great earthquake, such as had not occurred since man began to be on the earth — none so great;</span>
<span class="verse Rev_16_19" data-osis="Rev.16.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>and the great city was torn in three, and the cities of the nation fell, and God remembered Babylon the Great, and gave her the maddening wine-cup of his wrath;</span>
<span class="verse Rev_16_20" data-osis="Rev.16.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>and every island vanished, and the mountains disappeared.</span>
<span class="verse Rev_16_21" data-osis="Rev.16.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>Great hailstones, a pound in weight, are falling on men from the heavens. And men blasphemed God because of the curse of the hail, for it was a very terrible curse.</span>

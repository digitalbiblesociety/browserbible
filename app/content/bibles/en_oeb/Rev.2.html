<span class="verse Rev_2_2" data-osis="Rev.2.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> I know your life, your toil and endurance, and I know that you cannot tolerate evil-doers. I know, too, how you tested those who declare that they are Apostles, though they are not, and how you proved them false.</span></span>
<span class="verse Rev_2_3" data-osis="Rev.2.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> You possess endurance, and have borne much for my Name, and have never grown weary.</span></span>
<span class="verse Rev_2_4" data-osis="Rev.2.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> But this I have against you &mdash; You have abandoned your first love.</span></span>
<span class="verse Rev_2_5" data-osis="Rev.2.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Therefore remember from what you have fallen, and repent, and live the life that you lived before; or else, I will come and remove your Lamp from its place, unless you repent.</span></span>
<span class="verse Rev_2_6" data-osis="Rev.2.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> But this is in your favour &mdash; You hate the life lived by the Nikolaitans, and I also hate it.</span></span>
<span class="verse Rev_2_7" data-osis="Rev.2.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Let him who has ears hear what the Spirit is saying to the Churches. To him who conquers &mdash;  to him I will give the right &lsquo;to eat the fruit of the Tree of life, which stands in the Paradise of God.&rsquo; &ldquo;</span></span>
<span class="verse Rev_2_8" data-osis="Rev.2.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> To the Angel of the Church in Smyrna write: &mdash;  &ldquo;These are the words of him who is the First and the Last, who died, but is restored to life: &mdash; </span></span>
<span class="verse Rev_2_9" data-osis="Rev.2.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> I know your persecution and your poverty &mdash; yet you are rich! I know, too, the slander that come from those who declare that they are Jews, though they are not, but are a Congregation of Satan.</span></span>
<span class="verse Rev_2_10" data-osis="Rev.2.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Do not be afraid of what you are about to suffer. The Devil is about to throw some of you into prison, that you may be tempted, and may undergo persecution for ten days. Be faithful even to death, and I will give you the Crown of Life.</span></span>
<span class="verse Rev_2_11" data-osis="Rev.2.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Let him who has ears hear what the Spirit is saying to the Churches. He who conquers shall suffer no hurt from the Second Death.&rdquo;</span></span>
<span class="verse Rev_2_12" data-osis="Rev.2.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> To the Angel of the Church in Pergamus write: &mdash;  &ldquo;These are the words of him who holds the sharp two-edged sword: &mdash; </span></span>
<span class="verse Rev_2_13" data-osis="Rev.2.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> I know where you dwell, where the Throne of Satan stands.

<span class="verse Rev_2_14" data-osis="Rev.2.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Yet I have a few things against you &mdash; You have among you those who hold to the Teaching of Balaam, who taught Balak to put temptations in the way of the Israelites, so that they should eat idol-offerings and commit licentious acts.</span></span>
<span class="verse Rev_2_15" data-osis="Rev.2.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Again you have among you those who hold in the same way to the Teaching of the Nikolaitans.</span></span>
<span class="verse Rev_2_16" data-osis="Rev.2.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Therefore repent, or else, I will come quickly and contend with such men with words that will cut like a sword.</span></span>
<span class="verse Rev_2_17" data-osis="Rev.2.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Let him who has ears hear what the Spirit is saying to the Churches.

<span class="verse Rev_2_18" data-osis="Rev.2.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> To the Angel of the Church in Thyatira write: &mdash;  &ldquo;These are the words of the Son of God, &lsquo;whose eyes are like flaming fire, and whose feet are like brass&rsquo;: &mdash; </span></span>
<span class="verse Rev_2_19" data-osis="Rev.2.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> I know your life, your love, faith, service, and endurance; and I know that your life of late has been better than it was at first.</span></span>
<span class="verse Rev_2_20" data-osis="Rev.2.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Yet I have this against you &mdash; You tolerate the woman Jezebel, who declares that she is a Prophetess, and misleads my servants by her teaching, till they commit licentious acts and eat idol-offerings.</span></span>
<span class="verse Rev_2_21" data-osis="Rev.2.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> I gave her time to repent, but she is determined not to turn from her licentiousness.</span></span>
<span class="verse Rev_2_22" data-osis="Rev.2.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Therefore I am laying her upon a bed of sickness, and bringing great suffering upon those who are unfaithful with her, unless they repent and turn from a life like hers.</span></span>
<span class="verse Rev_2_23" data-osis="Rev.2.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> I will also put her children to death; and all the Churches shall learn that I am he who &lsquo;looks into the hearts and souls of men&rsquo;; and I will give to each one of you what his life deserves.</span></span>
<span class="verse Rev_2_24" data-osis="Rev.2.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> But I say to the rest of you at Thyatira &mdash; all who do not accept such teaching, whose who did not learn &lsquo;the secrets of Satan,&rsquo; as men call them &mdash; I am not laying on you any further burden;</span></span>
<span class="verse Rev_2_25" data-osis="Rev.2.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> only hold fast to what you have received, until I come.</span></span>
<span class="verse Rev_2_26" data-osis="Rev.2.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> To him who conquers and is careful to live my life to the end &mdash; to him I will give authority over the nations,</span></span>
<span class="verse Rev_2_27" data-osis="Rev.2.27"><span class="verse-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> and &lsquo;he shall rule them with an iron rod, as when earthen vessels are broken in pieces&rsquo; (as I myself have received from my Father)</span></span>
<span class="verse Rev_2_28" data-osis="Rev.2.28"><span class="verse-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> and I will give him the Morning Star.</span></span>

<h4>The New Creation</h4>
<span class="verse Rev_21_1" data-osis="Rev.21.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>Then I saw new heavens and a new earth. The former heavens and the former earth had passed away; and the sea has ceased to be.</span>
<span class="verse Rev_21_2" data-osis="Rev.21.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>And I saw the Holy City, Jerusalem, descending new out of heaven from God, like a bride adorned in readiness for her husband.</span>
<span class="verse Rev_21_3" data-osis="Rev.21.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>And I heard a loud voice from the throne, which said —  ‘See! The tent of God is set up among people. God will live among them, and they will be his Peoples, and God himself will be among them,</span>
<span class="verse Rev_21_4" data-osis="Rev.21.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>and he will wipe away all tears from their eyes. There will be no more death, nor will there be any more grief or crying or pain. The old order has passed away.’</span>
<span class="verse Rev_21_5" data-osis="Rev.21.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>And he who was seated on the throne said —  ‘See, I make all things new!’ And he said —  ‘Write this, for these words may be trusted and are true.’</span>
<span class="verse Rev_21_6" data-osis="Rev.21.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>And he said to me —  ‘They are fulfilled. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the End. To those who thirst I will give of the spring of the water of life, freely.</span>
<span class="verse Rev_21_7" data-osis="Rev.21.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>Those who conquer will enter into possession of these things, and I will be their God, and they will be my children.</span>
<span class="verse Rev_21_8" data-osis="Rev.21.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>But as for cowards, unbelievers, the degraded, murderers, the impure, sorcerers, idolaters, and all liars — their place will be in the burning lake of fire and sulphur. That is the Second Death.’</span>
<span class="verse Rev_21_9" data-osis="Rev.21.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>Then one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls, and were laden with the seven last curses, came and spoke to me. ‘Come here,’ he said, ‘and I will show you the Bride, the Wife of the Lamb.’</span>
<span class="verse Rev_21_10" data-osis="Rev.21.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>He carried me away in a trance to a great high mountain, and showed me Jerusalem, the Holy City, descending out of heaven from God, filled with the glory of God.</span>
<span class="verse Rev_21_11" data-osis="Rev.21.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>Its brilliance was like a precious stone, like a jasper, transparent as crystal.</span>
<span class="verse Rev_21_12" data-osis="Rev.21.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>It had a great high wall, in which were twelve gates; and at these gates there were twelve angels, and there were names inscribed on the gates, the names of the twelve tribes of the Israelites.</span>
<span class="verse Rev_21_13" data-osis="Rev.21.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>‘There were three gates on the east, three gates on the north, three gates on the south, and three gates on the west.’</span>
<span class="verse Rev_21_14" data-osis="Rev.21.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>The wall of the city had twelve foundation stones, on which were the twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.</span>
<span class="verse Rev_21_15" data-osis="Rev.21.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>And the angel who was speaking to me had as a measure a gold rod, with which to measure the city and its gates and its wall.</span>
<span class="verse Rev_21_16" data-osis="Rev.21.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>The city is square; the length and the breadth are the same. The angel measured with his rod; it was twelve hundred miles; its length, and breadth, and height are equal.</span>
<span class="verse Rev_21_17" data-osis="Rev.21.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>Then he measured the wall; it was two hundred and eighty-eight feet, as people measure, that is as the angel measured.</span>
<span class="verse Rev_21_18" data-osis="Rev.21.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>The material of the wall of the city was jasper, and the city was built of pure gold, which shone like clear glass.</span>
<span class="verse Rev_21_19" data-osis="Rev.21.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>The foundations of the wall of the city were ornamented with every kind of precious stone. The first foundation stone was a jasper; the second a sapphire; the third a chalcedony; the fourth an emerald;</span>
<span class="verse Rev_21_20" data-osis="Rev.21.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>the fifth a sardonyx; the sixth a carnelian; the seventh a chrysolite; the eighth a beryl; the ninth a topaz; the tenth a chrysoprase; the eleventh a hyacinth; and the twelfth an amethyst.</span>
<span class="verse Rev_21_21" data-osis="Rev.21.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>The twelve gates were made of twelve pearls, each gate of one pearl. The street of the city was of pure gold, transparent as glass.</span>
<span class="verse Rev_21_22" data-osis="Rev.21.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>And I saw no Temple there, for the Lord, our God, the Almighty, and the Lamb are its Temple.</span>
<span class="verse Rev_21_23" data-osis="Rev.21.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>The city has no need of ‘the sun or the moon to shine on it, for the glory of God illuminated it,’ and its Lamp was the Lamb.</span>
<span class="verse Rev_21_24" data-osis="Rev.21.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span>‘The nations walk by the light of it; and the kings of the earth bring their glory into it.</span>
<span class="verse Rev_21_25" data-osis="Rev.21.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span>Its gates will never be shut by day,’ and there will be no night there.</span>
<span class="verse Rev_21_26" data-osis="Rev.21.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span>And people will bring the glory and honor of the nations into it.</span>
<span class="verse Rev_21_27" data-osis="Rev.21.27"><span class="verse-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span>‘Never will any unhallowed thing enter it,’ nor they whose life is shameful and false, but only ‘those whose names have been written in the Lamb’s book of life.’</span>

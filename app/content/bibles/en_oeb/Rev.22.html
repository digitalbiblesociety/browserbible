<span class="verse" data-osis="Rev.22.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>And the angel showed me &lsquo;a river of the Water of Life,&rsquo; as clear as crystal, issuing from the throne of God and of the Lamb,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rev.22.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>in the middle of the street of the City. On each side of the river was a Tree of Life which bore twelve kinds of fruit, yielding its fruit each month; and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rev.22.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>&lsquo;Every thing that is accursed will cease to be.&rsquo; The throne of God and of the Lamb will be within it, and his servants will worship him;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rev.22.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>they will see his face, and his name will be on their foreheads.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rev.22.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>Night will cease to be. They have no need of the light of a lamp, nor have they the light of the sun; for the &lsquo;Lord God will be their light, and they will reign for ever and ever.&rsquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rev.22.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>Then the angel said to me &mdash;  &lsquo;These words may be trusted and are true. The Lord, the God that inspires the Prophets, sent his angel to show his servants what must quickly take place;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rev.22.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>and he said <span class="woc"> &ldquo;I will come quickly.&rdquo;</span>  Blessed will he be who lays to heart the words of the prophecy contained in this book.&rsquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rev.22.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>It was I, John, who heard and saw these things; and, when I heard and saw them, I prostrated myself in worship at the feet of the angel that showed them to me.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rev.22.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>But he said to me &mdash;  &lsquo;Forbear; I am your fellow-servant, and the fellow-servant of your Brothers, the Prophets, and of all who lay to heart the words in this book. Worship God.&rsquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rev.22.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>Then the angel said to me &mdash;  &lsquo;Do not keep secret the words of the prophecy contained in this book; for The Time is near.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rev.22.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>Let the wrong-doer continue to do wrong; the filthy-minded man continue to be filthy; the righteous man continue to act righteously; and the holy-minded man continue to be holy.&rsquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rev.22.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> (&lsquo;I will come quickly. I bring my rewards with me, to give to each man what his actions deserve.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rev.22.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> I am the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End.&rsquo;)</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rev.22.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>Blessed will they be who wash their robes, that they may have the right to approach the Tree of Life, and may enter the City by the gates.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rev.22.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>Outside will be the filthy, the sorcerers, the impure, the murderers, the idolaters, and all who love the false and live it.&rsquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rev.22.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &lsquo;I, Jesus, sent my angel to bear testimony to you about these things before the Churches. I am the Scion and the Offspring of David, the bright Star of the Morning.&rsquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rev.22.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span>&lsquo;Come,&rsquo; say the Spirit and the Bride; and let him who hears say &lsquo;Come.&rsquo; Let him who thirsts come; let him who will take the Water of Life freely.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rev.22.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span>I declare to all who hear the words of the prophecy contained in this book &mdash;  &lsquo;If anyone adds to it, God will add to his troubles the Curses described in this book;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rev.22.20"><span class="verse-num">20&nbsp;</span>He whose testimony this is says &mdash;  <span class="woc"> &lsquo;Assuredly I will come quickly.&rsquo;</span>  &lsquo;Amen, come, Lord Jesus.&rsquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rev.22.21"><span class="verse-num">21&nbsp;</span>May the blessing of the Lord Jesus Christ, be with his People.</span>

<span class="verse Rev_3_2" data-osis="Rev.3.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Be on the watch, and strengthen what still survives, though once it was all but dead; for I have not found your life perfect in the eyes of my God.</span></span>
<span class="verse Rev_3_3" data-osis="Rev.3.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Therefore remember what you have received and heard, and lay it to heart and repent. Unless you are on the watch, I will come like a thief, and you will not know at what hour I am coming to you.</span></span>
<span class="verse Rev_3_4" data-osis="Rev.3.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Yet there are some few among you at Sardis who did not soil their robes; they will walk with me, robed in white, for they are worthy.</span></span>
<span class="verse Rev_3_5" data-osis="Rev.3.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Those who conquer will be clothed in these white robes, and I will not ‘strike their name out of the book of life’; but I will own them before my Father, and before his angels.</span></span>
<span class="verse Rev_3_6" data-osis="Rev.3.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Let those who have ears hear what the Spirit is saying to the churches.”</span></span>
<span class="verse Rev_3_7" data-osis="Rev.3.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">To the angel of the church in Philadelphia write: —<p />“These are the words of him who is holy and true, who holds ‘the Key of David, who opens and no one will shut, and shuts and no one opens’: — </span></span>
<span class="verse Rev_3_8" data-osis="Rev.3.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">I know your life (see, I have set a door open before you which no one is able to shut), I know that, though you have but little strength, you kept my teaching in mind, and did not disown my name.</span></span>
<span class="verse Rev_3_9" data-osis="Rev.3.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Listen, I give some of the Congregation of Satan, the people who declare that they are God's people{God’s people: Literally ‘Jews.’ These people claimed to be God’s people because they were Jews.}, though they are not, but are lying — I will make them ‘come and bow down at your feet,’ and they will learn that I loved you.</span></span>
<span class="verse Rev_3_10" data-osis="Rev.3.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Because you kept in mind the story of my endurance, I will keep you in the hour of trial that is about to come on the whole world, the hour that will test all who are living on earth.</span></span>
<span class="verse Rev_3_11" data-osis="Rev.3.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">I will come quickly. Hold to what you have received so that no one may take your crown.</span></span>
<span class="verse Rev_3_12" data-osis="Rev.3.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Those who conquer — I will make them a pillar in the Temple of my God; and never more will they leave it; and I will write on them the name of my God and the name of the city of my God, the New Jerusalem, which is coming down out of heaven from my God, and I will write on them my new name.</span></span>
<span class="verse Rev_3_13" data-osis="Rev.3.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Let those who have ears hear what the Spirit is saying to the churches.”</span></span>

<span class="verse Rev_3_15" data-osis="Rev.3.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">I know your life; I know that you are neither cold nor hot. If only you were either cold or hot!</span></span>
<span class="verse Rev_3_16" data-osis="Rev.3.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">But now, because you are lukewarm, neither hot not cold, I am about to spit you out of my mouth.</span></span>
<span class="verse Rev_3_17" data-osis="Rev.3.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">You say ‘I am rich and have grown rich, and I want for nothing,’ and you do not know that you are wretched, miserable, poor, blind, naked!</span></span>
<span class="verse Rev_3_18" data-osis="Rev.3.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Therefore I counsel you to buy from me gold which has been refined by fire so that you may grow rich; and white robes, so that you may be clothed and your shameful nakedness be hidden; and ointment to anoint your eyes, so that you may see.</span></span>
<span class="verse Rev_3_19" data-osis="Rev.3.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">‘All whom I love I rebuke and discipline.’ Therefore be in earnest and repent.</span></span>
<span class="verse Rev_3_20" data-osis="Rev.3.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">I am standing at the door and knocking! If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will go in, and will feast with them, and they will feast with me.</span></span>

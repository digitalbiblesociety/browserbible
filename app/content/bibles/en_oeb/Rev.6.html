<p>
<span class="verse Rev_6_1" data-osis="Rev.6.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>Then I saw the Lamb break one of the seven seals, and I heard one of the four Creatures crying with a voice like thunder — ‘Come.’</span>
<span class="verse Rev_6_2" data-osis="Rev.6.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>And in my vision I saw ‘a white horse.’ Its rider held a bow, and he was given a crown, and he went out conquering and to conquer.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Rev_6_3" data-osis="Rev.6.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>When the Lamb broke the second seal, I heard the second Creature crying — ‘Come.’</span>
<span class="verse Rev_6_4" data-osis="Rev.6.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>Then there went out another horse, ‘a red horse,’ and to its rider was given the power to deprive the earth of peace, so that people should kill one another; and he was given a great sword.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Rev_6_5" data-osis="Rev.6.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>When the Lamb broke the third seal, I heard the third Creature crying — ‘Come.’ And in my vision I saw ‘a black horse.’ Its rider held scales in his hand.</span>
<span class="verse Rev_6_6" data-osis="Rev.6.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>And I heard what seemed to be a voice, coming from among the four Creatures, crying — ‘A quart of wheat for a silver coin, and three quarts of barley for a silver coin! But do not harm the oil and the wine.’</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Rev_6_7" data-osis="Rev.6.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>When the Lamb broke the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth Creature crying —  ‘Come.’</span>
<span class="verse Rev_6_8" data-osis="Rev.6.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>And in my vision I saw a grey horse. His rider’s name was Death, and the Lord of the place of Death rode behind him; and power was given them over the fourth part of the earth, so that they might ‘destroy with sword and famine and death, and by means of the wild beasts of the earth.’</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Rev_6_9" data-osis="Rev.6.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>When the Lamb opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of those who had been killed for the sake of God’s message and for the testimony which they had borne.</span>
<span class="verse Rev_6_10" data-osis="Rev.6.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>They cried in a loud voice — ‘How long, Sovereign Lord, holy and true, before you will give judgment and avenge our blood on all who are living on the earth?’</span>
<span class="verse Rev_6_11" data-osis="Rev.6.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>Then to each of them was given a white robe, and they were told to rest yet a little longer, until the number of their fellow servants and of their friends in Christ's service who were about to be put to death, as they had been, should be complete.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Rev_6_12" data-osis="Rev.6.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>And I saw the Lamb break the sixth seal, and then there was a great earthquake. The sun became black, like sackcloth, and the moon, which was at its full, like blood.</span>
<span class="verse Rev_6_13" data-osis="Rev.6.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>‘The stars of the heavens fell’ to the earth, as when a fig-tree, shaken by a strong wind, drops its unripe fruit.</span>
<span class="verse Rev_6_14" data-osis="Rev.6.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>The heavens disappeared like a scroll when it is rolled up, and every mountain and island was moved from its place.</span>
<span class="verse Rev_6_15" data-osis="Rev.6.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>Then all the kings of the earth, and the princes, and the generals, and the rich, and the powerful, and every slave and free person, ‘hid themselves in the caves and under the rocks’ of the mountains;</span>
<span class="verse Rev_6_16" data-osis="Rev.6.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>and they are crying to the mountains and the rocks —  ‘Fall on us, and hide us from the eyes of him who is seated on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb,</span>
<span class="verse Rev_6_17" data-osis="Rev.6.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>for the great day of their wrath is come, and who can stand to meet it?’</span>

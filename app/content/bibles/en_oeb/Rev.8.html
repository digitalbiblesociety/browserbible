<p>
<span class="verse Rev_8_1" data-osis="Rev.8.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>As soon as the Lamb had broken the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for, it might be, half an hour.</span>
</p>
<h4>Vision of Seven Trumpet-Blasts</h4>
<span class="verse Rev_8_2" data-osis="Rev.8.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>Then I saw the seven angels who stand before God, and seven trumpets were given to them.</span>
<p>
<span class="verse Rev_8_3" data-osis="Rev.8.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>Next, another angel came and stood at the altar with a golden censer in his hand; and a great quantity of incense was given to him, to mingle with the prayers of all Christ’s people on the golden altar before the throne.</span>
<span class="verse Rev_8_4" data-osis="Rev.8.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>The smoke of the incense ascended, with the prayers of Christ’s people, from the hand of the angel before God.</span>
<span class="verse Rev_8_5" data-osis="Rev.8.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>Then the angel took the censer, and filled it with fire from the altar, and threw it down on the earth; and there followed ‘peals of thunder, cries, flashes of lightning,’ and an earthquake.</span>
<span class="verse Rev_8_6" data-osis="Rev.8.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>Then the seven angels holding the seven trumpets prepared to blow their blasts.</span>
<span class="verse Rev_8_7" data-osis="Rev.8.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>The first blew; and there came hail and fire mixed with blood, and it fell on the earth. A third part of the earth was burnt up, and a third of the trees, and every blade of grass.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Rev_8_8" data-osis="Rev.8.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>Then the second angel blew; and what appeared to be a great mountain, burning, was hurled into the sea. A third of the sea became blood,</span>
<span class="verse Rev_8_9" data-osis="Rev.8.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>and a third part of all created things that are in the sea — that is, of all living things — died, and a third of the ships was destroyed.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Rev_8_10" data-osis="Rev.8.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>Then the third angel blew; and there fell from the heavens a great star, burning like a torch. It fell on a third of the rivers and on the springs.</span>
<span class="verse Rev_8_11" data-osis="Rev.8.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>(The star is called ‘Wormwood.’) A third of the water became bitter as wormwood, and so bitter was the water that many died from drinking it.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Rev_8_12" data-osis="Rev.8.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>Then the fourth angel blew; and a third of the sun and a third of the moon and a third of the stars were blasted, so that a third of them was eclipsed, and for a third part of the day there was no light, and at night it was the same.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Rev_8_13" data-osis="Rev.8.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>And, in my vision, I heard an eagle flying in mid-heaven and crying in a loud voice — ‘Woe, woe, woe for all who live on the earth, at the other trumpet-blasts of the three angels who have yet to blow.’</span>

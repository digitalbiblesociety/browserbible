<h4>Introduction</h4>
<span class="verse Rom_1_1" data-osis="Rom.1.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>To all in Rome who are dear to God and have been called to become Christ’s people, from Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, who has been called to become an apostle, and has been set apart to tell God’s good news.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_1_2" data-osis="Rom.1.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>This good news God promised long ago through his prophets in the sacred scriptures,</span>
<span class="verse Rom_1_3" data-osis="Rom.1.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>concerning his Son, Jesus Christ, our Lord; who, as to his human nature, was descended from David,</span>
<span class="verse Rom_1_4" data-osis="Rom.1.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>but, as to the spirit of holiness within him, was miraculously designated Son of God by his resurrection from the dead.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_1_5" data-osis="Rom.1.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>Through him we received the gift of the apostolic office, to win submission to the faith among all nations for the glory of his name.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_1_6" data-osis="Rom.1.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>And among these nations are you — you who have been called to belong to Jesus Christ.</span>
<p>
<span class="verse Rom_1_7" data-osis="Rom.1.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>May God, our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ bless you and give you peace.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_1_8" data-osis="Rom.1.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ about you all, because the report of your faith is spreading throughout the world.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_1_9" data-osis="Rom.1.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>God, to whom I offer the worship of my soul as I tell the goodness of his Son, is my witness how constantly I mention you when I pray,</span>
<span class="verse Rom_1_10" data-osis="Rom.1.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>asking that, if he be willing, I may some day at last find the way open to visit you.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_1_11" data-osis="Rom.1.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>For I long to see you, in order to impart to you some spiritual gift and so give you fresh strength —</span>
<span class="verse Rom_1_12" data-osis="Rom.1.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>or rather that both you and I may find encouragement in each other’s faith.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_1_13" data-osis="Rom.1.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>I want you to know, my friends, that I have many times intended coming to see you — but until now I have been prevented — that I might find among you some fruit of my labors, as I have already among the other nations.</span>
</p>
<h4>Faith the Ground of Acceptance</h4>
<span class="verse Rom_1_14" data-osis="Rom.1.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>I have a duty to both the Greek and the barbarian, to both the cultured and the ignorant.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_1_15" data-osis="Rom.1.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>And so, for my part, I am ready to tell the good news to you also who are in Rome.</span>
<p>
<span class="verse Rom_1_16" data-osis="Rom.1.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>For I am not ashamed of the good news; it is the power of God which brings salvation to everyone who believes in Christ, to the Jew first, but also to the Greek.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_1_17" data-osis="Rom.1.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>For in it there is a revelation of the divine righteousness resulting from faith and leading on to faith; as scripture says — ‘Through faith the righteous will find life.’</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Rom_1_18" data-osis="Rom.1.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>So, too, there is a revelation from heaven of the divine wrath against every form of ungodliness and wickedness on the part of those people who, by their wicked lives, are stifling the truth.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_1_19" data-osis="Rom.1.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>This is so, because what can be known about God is plain to them; for God himself has made it plain.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_1_20" data-osis="Rom.1.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>For ever since the creation of the universe God’s invisible attributes — his everlasting power and divinity — are to be seen and studied in his works, so that people have no excuse;</span>
<span class="verse Rom_1_21" data-osis="Rom.1.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>because, although they learned to know God, yet they did not offer him as God either praise or thanksgiving. Their speculations about him proved futile, and their undiscerning minds were darkened.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_1_22" data-osis="Rom.1.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>Professing to be wise, they showed themselves fools;</span>
<span class="verse Rom_1_23" data-osis="Rom.1.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>and they transformed the glory of the immortal God into the likeness of mortal humans, and of birds, and beasts, and reptiles.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Rom_1_24" data-osis="Rom.1.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span>Therefore God abandoned them to impurity, letting them follow the cravings of their hearts, until they dishonored their own bodies;</span>
<span class="verse Rom_1_25" data-osis="Rom.1.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span>for they had substituted a lie for the truth about God, and had reverenced and worshiped created things more than the Creator, who is to be praised for ever. Amen.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_1_26" data-osis="Rom.1.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span>That, I say, is why God abandoned them to degrading passions. Even the women among them perverted the natural use of their bodies to the unnatural;</span>
<span class="verse Rom_1_27" data-osis="Rom.1.27"><span class="verse-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span>while the men, disregarding that for which women were intended by nature, were consumed with passion for one another. Men indulged in vile practices with men, and incurred in their own persons the inevitable penalty for their perverseness.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Rom_1_28" data-osis="Rom.1.28"><span class="verse-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span>Then, as they would not keep God before their minds, God abandoned them to depraved thoughts, so that they did all kinds of shameful things.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_1_29" data-osis="Rom.1.29"><span class="verse-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span>They reveled in every form of wickedness, evil, greed, vice. Their lives were full of envy, murder, quarreling, treachery, malice.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_1_30" data-osis="Rom.1.30"><span class="verse-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span>They became back-biters, slanderers, impious, insolent, boastful. They devised new sins. They disobeyed their parents.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_1_31" data-osis="Rom.1.31"><span class="verse-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span>They were undiscerning, untrustworthy, without natural affection or pity.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_1_32" data-osis="Rom.1.32"><span class="verse-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span>Well aware of God’s decree, that those who do such things deserve to die, not only are they guilty of them themselves, but they even applaud those who do them.</span>

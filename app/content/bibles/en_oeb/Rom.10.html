<h2 class="chapter-num">10</h2>
<p>
<span class="verse Rom_10_1" data-osis="Rom.10.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>My friends, my heart’s desire and prayer to God for my people is for their salvation.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_10_2" data-osis="Rom.10.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>I can testify that they are zealous for the honor of God; but they are not guided by true insight,</span>
<span class="verse Rom_10_3" data-osis="Rom.10.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>for, in their ignorance of the divine righteousness, and in their eagerness to set up a righteousness of their own, they refused to accept with submission the divine righteousness.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_10_4" data-osis="Rom.10.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>For Christ has brought law to an end, so that righteousness may be obtained by everyone who believes in him.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_10_5" data-osis="Rom.10.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>For Moses writes that, as for the righteousness which results from law, ‘those who practice it will find life through it.’</span>
<span class="verse Rom_10_6" data-osis="Rom.10.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>But the righteousness which results from faith finds expression in these words — ‘Do not say to yourself “Who will go up into heaven?”’ — which means to bring Christ down —</span>
<span class="verse Rom_10_7" data-osis="Rom.10.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>‘or “Who will go down into the depths below?”’ — which means to bring Christ up from the dead.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_10_8" data-osis="Rom.10.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>No, but what does it say? ‘The message of faith’ which we proclaim.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_10_9" data-osis="Rom.10.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>For, if with your lips you acknowledge the truth of the message that JESUS IS LORD, and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_10_10" data-osis="Rom.10.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>For with their hearts people believe and so attain to righteousness, while with their lips they make their Profession of faith and so find salvation.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_10_11" data-osis="Rom.10.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>As the passage of scripture says — ‘No one who believes in him will have any cause for shame.’</span>
<span class="verse Rom_10_12" data-osis="Rom.10.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>For no distinction is made between the Jew and the Greek, for all have the same Lord, and he is bountiful to all who invoke him.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_10_13" data-osis="Rom.10.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>For ‘everyone who invokes the name of the Lord will be saved.’</span>
<span class="verse Rom_10_14" data-osis="Rom.10.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>But how, it may be asked, are they to invoke one in whom they have not learned to believe? And how are they to believe in one whose words they have not heard? And how are they to hear his words unless some one proclaims him?</span>
<span class="verse Rom_10_15" data-osis="Rom.10.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>And how is anyone to proclaim him unless they are sent as his messengers? As scripture says — ‘How beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news!’</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Rom_10_16" data-osis="Rom.10.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>Still, it may be said, everyone did not give heed to the good news. No, for Isaiah asks — ‘Lord, who has believed our teaching?’</span>
<span class="verse Rom_10_17" data-osis="Rom.10.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>And so we gather, faith is a result of teaching, and the teaching comes in the message of Christ.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_10_18" data-osis="Rom.10.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>But I ask ‘Is it possible that people have never heard?’ No, indeed, for — ‘Their voices spread through all the earth, and their message to the  ends of the world.’</span>
<span class="verse Rom_10_19" data-osis="Rom.10.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>But again I ask ‘Did not the people of Israel understand? First there is Moses, who says — ‘I, the Lord, will stir you to rivalry with a nation which is no nation; Against an undiscerning nation I will arouse your anger.’</span>
<span class="verse Rom_10_20" data-osis="Rom.10.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>And Isaiah says boldly — ‘I was found by those who were not seeking me; I made myself known to those who were not inquiring of me.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_10_21" data-osis="Rom.10.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>But of the people of Israel he says — ‘All day long I have stretched out my hands to a people who disobey and contradict.’</span>

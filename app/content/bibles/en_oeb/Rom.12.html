<h4>Advice on Daily Life</h4>
<span class="verse Rom_12_1" data-osis="Rom.12.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>I entreat you, then, friends, by the mercies of God, to offer your bodies as a living and holy sacrifice, acceptable to God, for this is your rational worship.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_12_2" data-osis="Rom.12.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>Do not conform to the fashion of this world; but be transformed by the complete change that has come over your minds, so that you may discern what God’s will is — all that is good, acceptable, and perfect.</span>
<p>
<span class="verse Rom_12_3" data-osis="Rom.12.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>In fulfillment of the charge with which I have been entrusted, I tell every one of you not to think more highly of himself than he ought to think, but to think until he learns to think soberly — in accordance with the measure of faith that God has allotted to each.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_12_4" data-osis="Rom.12.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>For, just as in the human body there is a union of many parts, and each part has its own function,</span>
<span class="verse Rom_12_5" data-osis="Rom.12.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>so we, by our union in Christ, many though we are, form but one body, and individually we are related one to another as its parts.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_12_6" data-osis="Rom.12.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>Since our gifts differ in accordance with the particular charge entrusted to us, if our gift is to preach, let our preaching correspond to our faith;</span>
<span class="verse Rom_12_7" data-osis="Rom.12.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>if it is to minister to others, let us devote ourselves to our ministry; the teacher to their teaching,</span>
<span class="verse Rom_12_8" data-osis="Rom.12.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>the counselor to their counsel. Let the person who gives in charity do so with a generous heart; let the person who is in authority exercise due diligence; let the person who shows kindness do so in a cheerful spirit.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_12_9" data-osis="Rom.12.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>Let your love be sincere. Hate the wrong; cling to the right.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_12_10" data-osis="Rom.12.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>In the love of the community of the Lord's followers, be affectionate to one another; in showing respect, set an example of deference to one another;</span>
<span class="verse Rom_12_11" data-osis="Rom.12.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>never flagging in zeal; fervent in spirit; serving the Master;</span>
<span class="verse Rom_12_12" data-osis="Rom.12.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>rejoicing in your hope; steadfast under persecution; persevering in prayer;</span>
<span class="verse Rom_12_13" data-osis="Rom.12.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>relieving the wants of Christ’s people; devoted to hospitality.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_12_14" data-osis="Rom.12.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>Bless your persecutors — bless and never curse.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_12_15" data-osis="Rom.12.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>Rejoice with those who are rejoicing, and weep with those who are weeping.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_12_16" data-osis="Rom.12.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>Let the same spirit of sympathy animate you all, not a spirit of pride; enjoy the company of ordinary people. Do not think too highly of yourselves.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_12_17" data-osis="Rom.12.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>Never return injury for injury. Aim at doing what everyone will recognize as honorable.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_12_18" data-osis="Rom.12.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>If it is possible, as far as rests with you, live peaceably with everyone.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_12_19" data-osis="Rom.12.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>Never avenge yourselves, dear friends, but make way for the wrath of God; for scripture declares — ‘“It is for me to avenge, I will requite,” says the Lord.’</span>
<span class="verse Rom_12_20" data-osis="Rom.12.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>Rather — ‘If your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him to drink. By doing this you will heap coals of fire on his head.’</span>
<span class="verse Rom_12_21" data-osis="Rom.12.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>Never be conquered by evil, but conquer evil with good.</span>

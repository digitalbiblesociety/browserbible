<p>
<span class="verse Rom_13_1" data-osis="Rom.13.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>Let every one obey the supreme Authorities. For no Authority exists except by the will of God, and the existing Authorities have been appointed by God.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_13_2" data-osis="Rom.13.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>Therefore he who sets himself against the authorities is resisting God&rsquo;s appointment, and those who resist will bring a judgment upon themselves.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_13_3" data-osis="Rom.13.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>A good action has nothing to fear from Rulers; a bad action has. Do you want to have no reason to fear the Authorities? Then do what is good, and you will win their praise.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_13_4" data-osis="Rom.13.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>For they are God&rsquo;s servants appointed for your good. But, if you do what is wrong, you may well be afraid; for the sword they carry is not without meaning! They are God&rsquo;s servants to inflict his punishments on those who do wrong.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_13_5" data-osis="Rom.13.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>You are bound, therefore, to obey, not only through fear of God&rsquo;s punishments, but also as a matter of conscience.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_13_6" data-osis="Rom.13.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>This, too, is the reason for your paying taxes; for the officials are God&rsquo;s officers, devoting themselves to this special work.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_13_7" data-osis="Rom.13.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>In all cases pay what is due from you &mdash; tribute where tribute is due, taxes where taxes are due, respect where respect is due, and honour where honour is due.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Rom_13_8" data-osis="Rom.13.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>Owe nothing to any one except brotherly love; for he who loves his fellow men has satisfied the Law.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_13_9" data-osis="Rom.13.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>The commandments, &lsquo;Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not covet,&rsquo; and whatever other commandment there is, are all summed up in the words &mdash; &lsquo;Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thou dost thyself.&rsquo;</span>
<span class="verse Rom_13_10" data-osis="Rom.13.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>Love never wrongs a neighbour. Therefore Love fully satisfies the Law.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_13_11" data-osis="Rom.13.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>This I say, because you know the crisis that we have reached, for the time has already come for you to rouse yourselves from sleep; our Salvation is nearer now than when we accepted the Faith.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Rom_13_12" data-osis="Rom.13.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>The night is almost gone; the day is near. Therefore let us have done with the deeds of Darkness, and arm ourselves with the weapons of Light.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_13_13" data-osis="Rom.13.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>Being in the light of Day, let us live becomingly, not in revelry and drunkenness, not in lust and licentiousness, not in quarrelling and jealousy.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_13_14" data-osis="Rom.13.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>No! Arm yourselves with the spirit of the Lord Jesus Christ, and spend no thought on your earthly nature, to satisfy its cravings.</span>

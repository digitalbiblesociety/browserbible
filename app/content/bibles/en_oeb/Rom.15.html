<h2 class="chapter-num">15</h2>
<p>
<span class="verse Rom_15_1" data-osis="Rom.15.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>We, the strong, ought to take on our own shoulders the weaknesses of those who are not strong, and not merely to please ourselves.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_15_2" data-osis="Rom.15.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>Let each of us please our neighbor for our neighbor’s good, to help in the building up of their character.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_15_3" data-osis="Rom.15.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>Even the Christ did not please himself! On the contrary, as scripture says of him — ‘The reproaches of those who were reproaching you fell upon me.’</span>
<span class="verse Rom_15_4" data-osis="Rom.15.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>Whatever was written in the scriptures in days gone by was written for our instruction, so that, through patient endurance, and through the encouragement drawn from the scriptures, we might hold fast to our hope.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_15_5" data-osis="Rom.15.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>And may God, the giver of this patience and this encouragement, grant you to be united in sympathy in Christ,</span>
<span class="verse Rom_15_6" data-osis="Rom.15.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>so that with one heart and one voice you may praise the God and Father of Jesus Christ, our Lord.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_15_7" data-osis="Rom.15.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>Therefore always receive one another as friends, just as the Christ himself received us, to the glory of God.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_15_8" data-osis="Rom.15.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>For I tell you that Christ, in vindication of God’s truthfulness, has become a minister of the covenant of circumcision, so that he may fulfill the promises made to our ancestors,</span>
<span class="verse Rom_15_9" data-osis="Rom.15.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>and that the Gentiles also may praise God for his mercy. As scripture says — ‘Therefore will I make acknowledgment to you among the Gentiles and sing in honor of your name.’</span>
<span class="verse Rom_15_10" data-osis="Rom.15.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>And again it says — ‘Rejoice, you Gentiles, with God’s people.’</span>
<span class="verse Rom_15_11" data-osis="Rom.15.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>And yet again — ‘Praise the Lord, all you Gentiles, and let all Peoples sing his praises.’</span>
<span class="verse Rom_15_12" data-osis="Rom.15.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>Again, Isaiah says — ‘There will be a Scion of the house of Jesse, One who is to arise to rule the Gentiles; on him will the Gentiles rest their hopes.’</span>
<span class="verse Rom_15_13" data-osis="Rom.15.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>May God, who inspires our hope, grant you perfect happiness and peace in your faith, until you are filled with this hope by the power of the Holy Spirit.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Rom_15_14" data-osis="Rom.15.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>I am persuaded, my friends — yes, I Paul, with regard to you — that you are yourselves full of kindness, furnished with all Christian learning, and well able to give advice to one another.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_15_15" data-osis="Rom.15.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>But in parts of this letter I have expressed myself somewhat boldly — by way of refreshing your memories —</span>
<span class="verse Rom_15_16" data-osis="Rom.15.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>because of the charge with which God has entrusted me, that I should be a minister of Christ Jesus to go to the Gentiles — that I should act as a priest of God’s good news, so that the offering up of the Gentiles may be an acceptable sacrifice, consecrated by the Holy Spirit.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_15_17" data-osis="Rom.15.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>It is, then, through my union with Christ Jesus that I have a proud confidence in my work for God.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_15_18" data-osis="Rom.15.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>For I will not dare to speak of anything but what Christ has done through me to win the obedience of the Gentiles —</span>
<span class="verse Rom_15_19" data-osis="Rom.15.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>by my words and actions, through the power displayed in signs and marvels, and through the power of the Holy Spirit. And so, starting from Jerusalem and its neighborhood, and going as far as Illyria, I have told in full the good news of the Christ;</span>
<span class="verse Rom_15_20" data-osis="Rom.15.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>yet always with the ambition to tell the good news where Christ’s name had not previously been heard, so as to avoid building on another’s foundations.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_15_21" data-osis="Rom.15.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>But as scripture says — ‘They to whom he had never been proclaimed will see; and they who have never heard will understand!’</span>
</p>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<span class="verse Rom_15_22" data-osis="Rom.15.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>That is why I have so often been prevented from coming to you.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_15_23" data-osis="Rom.15.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>But now there are no further openings for me in these parts, and I have for several years been longing to come to you whenever I may be going to Spain.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_15_24" data-osis="Rom.15.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span>For my hope is to visit you on my journey, and then to be sent on my way by you, after I have first partly satisfied myself by seeing something of you.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_15_25" data-osis="Rom.15.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span>Just now, however, I am on my way to Jerusalem, to take help to Christ’s people there.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_15_26" data-osis="Rom.15.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span>For Macedonia and Greece have been glad to make a collection for the poor among Christ’s people at Jerusalem.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_15_27" data-osis="Rom.15.27"><span class="verse-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span>Yes, they were glad to do so; and indeed it is a duty which they owe to them. For the Gentile converts who have shared their spiritual blessings are in duty bound to minister to them in the things of this world.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_15_28" data-osis="Rom.15.28"><span class="verse-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span>When I have settled this matter, and have secured to the poor at Jerusalem the enjoyment of these benefits, I will go, by way of you, to Spain.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_15_29" data-osis="Rom.15.29"><span class="verse-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span>And I know that, when I come to you, it will be with a full measure of blessing from Christ.</span>
<p>
<span class="verse Rom_15_30" data-osis="Rom.15.30"><span class="verse-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span>I beg you, then, friends, by Jesus Christ, our Lord, and by the love inspired by the Spirit, to join me in earnest prayer to God on my behalf.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_15_31" data-osis="Rom.15.31"><span class="verse-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span>Pray that I may be rescued from those in Judea who reject the faith, and that the help which I am taking to Jerusalem may prove acceptable to Christ’s people;</span>
<span class="verse Rom_15_32" data-osis="Rom.15.32"><span class="verse-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span>so that, God willing, I may be able to come to you with a joyful heart, and enjoy some rest among you.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_15_33" data-osis="Rom.15.33"><span class="verse-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span>May God, the giver of peace, be with you all. Amen.</span>

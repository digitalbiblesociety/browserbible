<p>
<span class="verse Rom_5_1" data-osis="Rom.5.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>Therefore, having been pronounced righteous as the result of faith, let us enjoy peace with God through Jesus Christ, our Lord.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_5_2" data-osis="Rom.5.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>It is through him that, by reason of our faith, we have obtained admission to that place in God’s favor in which we not stand. So let us exult in our hope of attaining God’s glorious ideal.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_5_3" data-osis="Rom.5.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>And not only that, but let us also exult in our troubles;</span>
<span class="verse Rom_5_4" data-osis="Rom.5.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>for we know that trouble develops endurance, and endurance strength of character, and strength of character hope,</span>
<span class="verse Rom_5_5" data-osis="Rom.5.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>and that ‘hope never disappoints.’ For the love of God has filled our hearts through the Holy Spirit which was given us;</span>
<span class="verse Rom_5_6" data-osis="Rom.5.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>seeing that, while we were still powerless, Christ, in God’s good time, died on behalf of the godless.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_5_7" data-osis="Rom.5.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>Even for an upright person scarcely anyone will die. For a really good person perhaps some one might even dare to die.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_5_8" data-osis="Rom.5.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>But God puts his love for us beyond all doubt by the fact that Christ died on our behalf while we were still sinners.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_5_9" data-osis="Rom.5.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>Much more, then, now that we have been pronounced righteous by virtue of the shedding of his blood, will we be saved through him from the wrath of God.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_5_10" data-osis="Rom.5.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>For if, when we were God’s enemies, we were reconciled to him through the death of his Son, much more, now that we have become reconciled, will we be saved by virtue of Christ’s life.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_5_11" data-osis="Rom.5.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>And not only that, but we exult in God, through Jesus Christ, our Lord, through whom we have now obtained this reconciliation.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Rom_5_12" data-osis="Rom.5.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>Therefore, just as sin came into the world through one man, and through sin came death; so, also, death spread to all humanity, because every person has sinned.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_5_13" data-osis="Rom.5.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>Even before the time of the law there was sin in the world; but sin cannot be charged against someone where no law exists.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_5_14" data-osis="Rom.5.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>Yet, from Adam to Moses, death reigned even over those whose sin was not a breach of a law, as Adam’s was. And Adam foreshadows the One to come.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_5_15" data-osis="Rom.5.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>But there is a contrast between Adam’s offense and God’s gracious gift. For, if by reason of the offense of the one man the whole race died, far more were the loving kindness of God, and the gift given in the loving kindness of the one man, Jesus Christ, lavished on the whole race.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_5_16" data-osis="Rom.5.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>There is a contrast, too, between the gift and the results of the one man’s sin. The judgment, which followed on the one man’s sin, resulted in condemnation, but God’s gracious gift, which followed on many offenses, resulted in a decree of righteousness.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_5_17" data-osis="Rom.5.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>For if, by reason of the offense of the one man, death reigned through that one man, far more will those, on whom God’s loving kindness and his gift of righteousness are lavished, find life, and reign through the one man, Jesus Christ.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_5_18" data-osis="Rom.5.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>Briefly then, just as a single offense resulted for all humanity in condemnation, so, too, a single decree of righteousness resulted for all humanity in that declaration of righteousness which brings life.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_5_19" data-osis="Rom.5.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>For, as through the disobedience of the one man the whole race was rendered sinful, so, too, through the obedience of the one, the whole race will be rendered righteous.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_5_20" data-osis="Rom.5.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>law was introduced in order that offenses might be multiplied. But, where sins were multiplied, the loving kindness of God was lavished the more,</span>
<span class="verse Rom_5_21" data-osis="Rom.5.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>in order than, just as sin had reigned in the realm of death, so, too, might Loving-kindness reign through righteousness, and result in eternal life, through Jesus Christ, our Lord.</span>

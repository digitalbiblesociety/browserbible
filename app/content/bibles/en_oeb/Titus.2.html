<p>
<span class="verse Titus_2_1" data-osis="Titus.2.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>You should, however, speak of such subjects as properly have a place in sound Christian teaching.</span>
<span class="verse Titus_2_2" data-osis="Titus.2.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>Teach that the older men should be temperate, serious, and discreet; strong in faith, love, and endurance.</span>
<span class="verse Titus_2_3" data-osis="Titus.2.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>So, too, that the older women should be reverent in their demeanor, and that they should avoid scandal, and beware of becoming slaves to drink;</span>
<span class="verse Titus_2_4" data-osis="Titus.2.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>that they should teach what is right, so as to train the younger women to love their husbands and children,</span>
<span class="verse Titus_2_5" data-osis="Titus.2.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>and to be discreet, pure-minded, domesticated, good women, respecting the authority of their husbands, in order that God’s message may not be maligned.</span>
<span class="verse Titus_2_6" data-osis="Titus.2.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>And so again with the younger men — impress on them the need of discretion.</span>
<span class="verse Titus_2_7" data-osis="Titus.2.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>Above all, set an example of doing good. Show sincerity in your teaching, and a serious spirit;</span>
<span class="verse Titus_2_8" data-osis="Titus.2.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>let the instruction that you give be sound and above reproach, so that the enemy may be ashamed when he fails to find anything bad to say about us.</span>
<span class="verse Titus_2_9" data-osis="Titus.2.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>Tell slaves to respect their owner's authority in all circumstances, and to try their best to please them.</span>
<span class="verse Titus_2_10" data-osis="Titus.2.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>Teach them not to contradict or to pilfer, but to show such praiseworthy fidelity in everything, as to recommend the teaching about God our Savior by all that they do.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Titus_2_11" data-osis="Titus.2.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>For the loving kindness of God has been revealed, bringing salvation for all;</span>
<span class="verse Titus_2_12" data-osis="Titus.2.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>leading us to renounce irreligious ways and worldly ambitions, and to live discreet, upright, and religious lives here in this present world,</span>
<span class="verse Titus_2_13" data-osis="Titus.2.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>while we are awaiting our blessed hope — the appearing in glory of our great God and Savior, Christ Jesus.</span>
<span class="verse Titus_2_14" data-osis="Titus.2.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>For he gave himself on our behalf, to deliver us from all wickedness, and to purify for himself a people who should be peculiarly his own and eager to do good.</span>
<span class="verse Titus_2_15" data-osis="Titus.2.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>Speak of all this, and encourage and rebuke with all authority. Do not let anyone despise you.</span>

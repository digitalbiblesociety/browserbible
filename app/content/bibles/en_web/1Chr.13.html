<span class="verse 1Chr_13_1" data-osis="1Chr.13.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>David consulted with the captains of thousands and of hundreds, even with every leader.</span>
<span class="verse 1Chr_13_2" data-osis="1Chr.13.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>David said to all the assembly of Israel, &ldquo;If it seems good to you, and if it is of Yahweh our God, let us send abroad everywhere to our brothers who are left in all the land of Israel, with whom the priests and Levites are in their cities that have suburbs, that they may gather themselves to us;</span>
<span class="verse 1Chr_13_3" data-osis="1Chr.13.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>and let us bring again the ark of our God to us. For we didn&rsquo;t seek it in the days of Saul.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse 1Chr_13_4" data-osis="1Chr.13.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>All the assembly said that they would do so; for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people.</span>
<span class="verse 1Chr_13_5" data-osis="1Chr.13.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>So David assembled all Israel together, from the Shihor the brook of Egypt even to the entrance of Hamath, to bring the ark of God from Kiriath Jearim.</span>
<span class="verse 1Chr_13_6" data-osis="1Chr.13.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>David went up, and all Israel, to Baalah, that is, to Kiriath Jearim, which belonged to Judah, to bring up from there the ark of God Yahweh that sits above the cherubim, that is called by the Name.</span>
<span class="verse 1Chr_13_7" data-osis="1Chr.13.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>They carried the ark of God on a new cart, and brought it out of the house of Abinadab: and Uzza and Ahio drove the cart.</span>
<span class="verse 1Chr_13_8" data-osis="1Chr.13.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>David and all Israel played before God with all their might, even with songs, and with harps, and with stringed instruments, and with tambourines, and with cymbals, and with trumpets.</span>
<span class="verse 1Chr_13_9" data-osis="1Chr.13.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>When they came to the threshing floor of Chidon, Uzza put out his hand to hold the ark; for the oxen stumbled.</span>
<span class="verse 1Chr_13_10" data-osis="1Chr.13.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>Yahweh&rsquo;s anger was kindled against Uzza, and he struck him, because he put out his hand to the ark; and there he died before God.</span>
<span class="verse 1Chr_13_11" data-osis="1Chr.13.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>David was displeased, because Yahweh had broken out against Uzza. He called that place Perez Uzza, to this day.</span>
<span class="verse 1Chr_13_12" data-osis="1Chr.13.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>David was afraid of God that day, saying, &ldquo;How shall I bring the ark of God home to me?&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse 1Chr_13_13" data-osis="1Chr.13.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>So David didn&rsquo;t move the ark to him into the city of David, but carried it aside into the house of Obed-Edom the Gittite.</span>
<span class="verse 1Chr_13_14" data-osis="1Chr.13.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>The ark of God remained with the family of Obed-Edom in his house three months: and Yahweh blessed the house of Obed-Edom, and all that he had.</span>

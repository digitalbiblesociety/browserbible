</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="1Chr.15.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>David assembled all Israel at Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of Yahweh to its place, which he had prepared for it.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Chr.15.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>David gathered together the sons of Aaron, and the Levites:</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Chr.15.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>For because you didn&rsquo;t carry it at first, Yahweh our God broke out in anger against us, because we didn&rsquo;t seek him according to the ordinance.&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="1Chr.15.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>So the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves to bring up the ark of Yahweh, the God of Israel.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Chr.15.20"><span class="verse-num">20&nbsp;</span>and Zechariah, and Aziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, and Eliab, and Maaseiah, and Benaiah, with stringed instruments set to Alamoth;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Chr.15.21"><span class="verse-num">21&nbsp;</span>and Mattithiah, and Eliphelehu, and Mikneiah, and Obed-Edom, and Jeiel, and Azaziah, with harps tuned to the eight-stringed lyre, to lead.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Chr.15.22"><span class="verse-num">22&nbsp;</span>Chenaniah, chief of the Levites, was over the song: he instructed about the song, because he was skillful.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Chr.15.23"><span class="verse-num">23&nbsp;</span>Berechiah and Elkanah were doorkeepers for the ark.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Chr.15.25"><span class="verse-num">25&nbsp;</span>So David, and the elders of Israel, and the captains over thousands, went to bring up the ark of the covenant of Yahweh out of the house of Obed-Edom with joy.</span>

<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="1Chr.21.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>Satan stood up against Israel, and moved David to number Israel.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Chr.21.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>David said to Joab and to the princes of the people, &ldquo;Go, number Israel from Beersheba even to Dan; and bring me word, that I may know the sum of them.&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="1Chr.21.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>Joab said, &ldquo;May Yahweh make his people a hundred times as many as they are. But, my lord the king, aren&rsquo;t they all my lord&rsquo;s servants? Why does my lord require this thing? Why will he be a cause of guilt to Israel?&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="1Chr.21.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>Nevertheless the king&rsquo;s word prevailed against Joab. Therefore Joab departed, and went throughout all Israel, and came to Jerusalem.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Chr.21.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>Joab gave up the sum of the numbering of the people to David. All those of Israel were one million one hundred thousand men who drew sword: and in Judah were four hundred seventy thousand men who drew sword.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Chr.21.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>But he didn&rsquo;t count Levi and Benjamin among them; for the king&rsquo;s word was abominable to Joab.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Chr.21.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>God was displeased with this thing; therefore he struck Israel.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Chr.21.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>David said to God, &ldquo;I have sinned greatly, in that I have done this thing. But now, put away, I beg you, the iniquity of your servant; for I have done very foolishly.&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="1Chr.21.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>Yahweh spoke to Gad, David&rsquo;s seer, saying,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Chr.21.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Go and speak to David, saying, &lsquo;Thus says Yahweh, &ldquo;I offer you three things. Choose one of them, that I may do it to you.&rdquo;&rsquo;&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="1Chr.21.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>So Gad came to David, and said to him, &ldquo;Thus says Yahweh, &lsquo;Take your choice:</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Chr.21.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>either three years of famine; or three months to be consumed before your foes, while the sword of your enemies overtakes you; or else three days the sword of Yahweh, even pestilence in the land, and the angel of Yahweh destroying throughout all the borders of Israel. Now therefore consider what answer I shall return to him who sent me.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="1Chr.21.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>David said to Gad, &ldquo;I am in distress. Let me fall, I pray, into the hand of Yahweh; for his mercies are very great. Let me not fall into the hand of man.&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="1Chr.21.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>So Yahweh sent a pestilence on Israel; and seventy thousand men of Israel fell.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Chr.21.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>God sent an angel to Jerusalem to destroy it. As he was about to destroy, Yahweh saw, and he relented of the disaster, and said to the destroying angel, &ldquo;It is enough; now stay your hand.&rdquo; The angel of Yahweh was standing by the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Chr.21.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span>David lifted up his eyes, and saw the angel of Yahweh standing between earth and the sky, having a drawn sword in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="1Chr.21.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span>David said to God, &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it I who commanded the people to be numbered? It is even I who have sinned and done very wickedly; but these sheep, what have they done? Please let your hand, O Yahweh my God, be against me, and against my father&rsquo;s house; but not against your people, that they should be plagued.&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="1Chr.21.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span>Then the angel of Yahweh commanded Gad to tell David that David should go up, and raise an altar to Yahweh in the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Chr.21.19"><span class="verse-num">19&nbsp;</span>David went up at the saying of Gad, which he spoke in Yahweh&rsquo;s name.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Chr.21.20"><span class="verse-num">20&nbsp;</span>Ornan turned back, and saw the angel; and his four sons who were with him hid themselves. Now Ornan was threshing wheat.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Chr.21.21"><span class="verse-num">21&nbsp;</span>As David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David, and went out of the threshing floor, and bowed himself to David with his face to the ground.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Chr.21.22"><span class="verse-num">22&nbsp;</span>Then David said to Ornan, &ldquo;Give me the place of this threshing floor, that I may build an altar to Yahweh on it. You shall sell it to me for the full price, that the plague may be stopped from afflicting the people.&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="1Chr.21.23"><span class="verse-num">23&nbsp;</span>Ornan said to David, &ldquo;Take it for yourself, and let my lord the king do that which is good in his eyes. Behold, I give the oxen for burnt offerings, and the threshing instruments for wood, and the wheat for the meal offering. I give it all.&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="1Chr.21.24"><span class="verse-num">24&nbsp;</span>King David said to Ornan, &ldquo;No; but I will most certainly buy it for the full price. For I will not take that which is yours for Yahweh, nor offer a burnt offering without cost.&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="1Chr.21.25"><span class="verse-num">25&nbsp;</span>So David gave to Ornan six hundred shekels of gold by weight for the place.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Chr.21.26"><span class="verse-num">26&nbsp;</span>David built an altar to Yahweh there, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings, and called on Yahweh; and he answered him from the sky by fire on the altar of burnt offering.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Chr.21.27"><span class="verse-num">27&nbsp;</span>Yahweh commanded the angel; and he put up his sword again into its sheath.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Chr.21.28"><span class="verse-num">28&nbsp;</span>At that time, when David saw that Yahweh had answered him in the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite, then he sacrificed there.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Chr.21.29"><span class="verse-num">29&nbsp;</span>For Yahweh&rsquo;s tabernacle, which Moses made in the wilderness, and the altar of burnt offering, were at that time in the high place at Gibeon.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Chr.21.30"><span class="verse-num">30&nbsp;</span>But David couldn&rsquo;t go before it to inquire of God; for he was afraid because of the sword of the angel of Yahweh.</span>

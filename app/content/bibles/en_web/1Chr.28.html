<span class="verse 1Chr_28_1" data-osis="1Chr.28.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>David assembled all the princes of Israel, the princes of the tribes, and the captains of the companies who served the king by division, and the captains of thousands, and the captains of hundreds, and the rulers over all the substance and possessions of the king and of his sons, with the officers, and the mighty men, even all the mighty men of valor, to Jerusalem.</span>
<span class="verse 1Chr_28_2" data-osis="1Chr.28.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>Then David the king stood up on his feet, and said, &ldquo;Hear me, my brothers, and my people! As for me, it was in my heart to build a house of rest for the ark of the covenant of Yahweh, and for the footstool of our God; and I had prepared for the building.</span>
<span class="verse 1Chr_28_3" data-osis="1Chr.28.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>But God said to me, &lsquo;You shall not build a house for my name, because you are a man of war, and have shed blood.&rsquo;</span>
<span class="verse 1Chr_28_4" data-osis="1Chr.28.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>However Yahweh, the God of Israel, chose me out of all the house of my father to be king over Israel forever. For he has chosen Judah to be prince; and in the house of Judah, the house of my father; and among the sons of my father he took pleasure in me to make me king over all Israel.</span>
<span class="verse 1Chr_28_5" data-osis="1Chr.28.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>Of all my sons (for Yahweh has given me many sons), he has chosen Solomon my son to sit on the throne of Yahweh&rsquo;s kingdom over Israel.</span>
<span class="verse 1Chr_28_6" data-osis="1Chr.28.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>He said to me, &lsquo;Solomon, your son, shall build my house and my courts; for I have chosen him to be my son, and I will be his father.</span>
<span class="verse 1Chr_28_7" data-osis="1Chr.28.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>I will establish his kingdom forever, if he continues to do my commandments and my ordinances, as at this day.&rsquo;</span>
<span class="verse 1Chr_28_8" data-osis="1Chr.28.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>Now therefore, in the sight of all Israel, Yahweh&rsquo;s assembly, and in the audience of our God, observe and seek out all the commandments of Yahweh your God; that you may possess this good land, and leave it for an inheritance to your children after you forever.</span>
<span class="verse 1Chr_28_9" data-osis="1Chr.28.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>You, Solomon my son, know the God of your father, and serve him with a perfect heart and with a willing mind; for Yahweh searches all hearts, and understands all the imaginations of the thoughts. If you seek him, he will be found by you; but if you forsake him, he will cast you off forever.</span>
<span class="verse 1Chr_28_10" data-osis="1Chr.28.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>Take heed now; for Yahweh has chosen you to build a house for the sanctuary. Be strong, and do it.&rdquo;</span>

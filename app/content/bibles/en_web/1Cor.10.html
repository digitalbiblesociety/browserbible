<span class="verse 1Cor_10_4" data-osis="1Cor.10.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>and all drank the same spiritual drink. For they drank of a spiritual rock that followed them, and the rock was Christ.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_10_5" data-osis="1Cor.10.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>However with most of them, God was not well pleased, for they were overthrown in the wilderness.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_10_6" data-osis="1Cor.10.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>Now these things were our examples, to the intent we should not lust after evil things, as they also lusted.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_10_7" data-osis="1Cor.10.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>Neither be idolaters, as some of them were.

<span class="verse 1Cor_10_8" data-osis="1Cor.10.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>Neither let us commit sexual immorality, as some of them committed, and in one day twenty-three thousand fell.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_10_9" data-osis="1Cor.10.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>Neither let us test the Lord, as some of them tested, and perished by the serpents.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_10_10" data-osis="1Cor.10.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>Neither grumble, as some of them also grumbled, and perished by the destroyer.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_10_11" data-osis="1Cor.10.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>Now all these things happened to them by way of example, and they were written for our admonition, on whom the ends of the ages have come.</span>

<span class="verse 1Cor_10_13" data-osis="1Cor.10.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>No temptation has taken you except what is common to man.

<span class="verse 1Cor_10_14" data-osis="1Cor.10.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>Therefore, my beloved, flee from idolatry.</span>

<span class="verse 1Cor_10_17" data-osis="1Cor.10.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>Because there is one loaf of bread, we, who are many, are one body; for we all partake of the one loaf of bread.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_10_18" data-osis="1Cor.10.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>Consider Israel according to the flesh. Don&rsquo;t those who eat the sacrifices participate in the altar?</span>

<span class="verse 1Cor_10_19" data-osis="1Cor.10.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>What am I saying then? That a thing sacrificed to idols is anything, or that an idol is anything?</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_10_20" data-osis="1Cor.10.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>But I say that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to demons, and not to God, and I don&rsquo;t desire that you would have fellowship with demons.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_10_21" data-osis="1Cor.10.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>You can&rsquo;t both drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons. You can&rsquo;t both partake of the table of the Lord, and of the table of demons.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_10_22" data-osis="1Cor.10.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>Or do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? Are we stronger than he?</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_10_23" data-osis="1Cor.10.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;All things are lawful for me,&rdquo; but not all things are profitable. &ldquo;All things are lawful for me,&rdquo; but not all things build up.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_10_24" data-osis="1Cor.10.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span>Let no one seek his own, but each one his neighbor&rsquo;s good.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_10_25" data-osis="1Cor.10.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span>Whatever is sold in the butcher shop, eat, asking no question for the sake of conscience,</span>

<span class="verse 1Cor_10_27" data-osis="1Cor.10.27"><span class="verse-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span>But if one of those who don&rsquo;t believe invites you to a meal, and you are inclined to go, eat whatever is set before you, asking no questions for the sake of conscience.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_10_28" data-osis="1Cor.10.28"><span class="verse-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span>But if anyone says to you, &ldquo;This was offered to idols,&rdquo; don&rsquo;t eat it for the sake of the one who told you, and for the sake of conscience. For &ldquo;the earth is the Lord&rsquo;s, and all its fullness.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_10_29" data-osis="1Cor.10.29"><span class="verse-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span>Conscience, I say, not your own, but the other&rsquo;s conscience. For why is my liberty judged by another conscience?</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_10_30" data-osis="1Cor.10.30"><span class="verse-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span>If I partake with thankfulness, why am I denounced for that for which I give thanks?</span>

<span class="verse 1Cor_10_33" data-osis="1Cor.10.33"><span class="verse-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span>even as I also please all men in all things, not seeking my own profit, but the profit of the many, that they may be saved.</span>

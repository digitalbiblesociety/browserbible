<span class="verse 1Cor_12_1" data-osis="1Cor.12.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>Now concerning spiritual things, brothers, I don&rsquo;t want you to be ignorant.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_12_2" data-osis="1Cor.12.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>You know that when you were heathen<span class="note">+<dfn>or Gentiles</dfn></span>, you were led away to those mute idols, however you might be led.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_12_3" data-osis="1Cor.12.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>Therefore I make known to you that no man speaking by God&rsquo;s Spirit says, &ldquo;Jesus is accursed.&rdquo; No one can say, &ldquo;Jesus is Lord,&rdquo; but by the Holy Spirit.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_12_4" data-osis="1Cor.12.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>Now there are various kinds of gifts, but the same Spirit.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse 1Cor_12_5" data-osis="1Cor.12.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>There are various kinds of service, and the same Lord.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_12_6" data-osis="1Cor.12.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>There are various kinds of workings, but the same God, who works all things in all.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_12_7" data-osis="1Cor.12.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>But to each one is given the manifestation of the Spirit for the profit of all.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_12_8" data-osis="1Cor.12.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>For to one is given through the Spirit the word of wisdom, and to another the word of knowledge, according to the same Spirit;</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_12_9" data-osis="1Cor.12.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>to another faith, by the same Spirit; and to another gifts of healings, by the same Spirit;</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_12_10" data-osis="1Cor.12.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>and to another workings of miracles; and to another prophecy; and to another discerning of spirits; to another different kinds of languages; and to another the interpretation of languages.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_12_11" data-osis="1Cor.12.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>But the one and the same Spirit works all of these, distributing to each one separately as he desires.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse 1Cor_12_12" data-osis="1Cor.12.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>For as the body is one, and has many members, and all the members of the body, being many, are one body; so also is Christ.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_12_13" data-osis="1Cor.12.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>For in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether bond or free; and were all given to drink into one Spirit.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_12_14" data-osis="1Cor.12.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>For the body is not one member, but many.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_12_15" data-osis="1Cor.12.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>If the foot would say, &ldquo;Because I&rsquo;m not the hand, I&rsquo;m not part of the body,&rdquo; it is not therefore not part of the body.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_12_16" data-osis="1Cor.12.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>If the ear would say, &ldquo;Because I&rsquo;m not the eye, I&rsquo;m not part of the body,&rdquo; it&rsquo;s not therefore not part of the body.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_12_17" data-osis="1Cor.12.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>If the whole body were an eye, where would the hearing be? If the whole were hearing, where would the smelling be?</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_12_18" data-osis="1Cor.12.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>But now God has set the members, each one of them, in the body, just as he desired.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_12_19" data-osis="1Cor.12.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>If they were all one member, where would the body be?</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_12_20" data-osis="1Cor.12.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>But now they are many members, but one body.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_12_21" data-osis="1Cor.12.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>The eye can&rsquo;t tell the hand, &ldquo;I have no need for you,&rdquo; or again the head to the feet, &ldquo;I have no need for you.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_12_22" data-osis="1Cor.12.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>No, much rather, those members of the body which seem to be weaker are necessary.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_12_23" data-osis="1Cor.12.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>Those parts of the body which we think to be less honorable, on those we bestow more abundant honor; and our unpresentable parts have more abundant propriety;</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_12_24" data-osis="1Cor.12.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span>whereas our presentable parts have no such need. But God composed the body together, giving more abundant honor to the inferior part,</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_12_25" data-osis="1Cor.12.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span>that there should be no division in the body, but that the members should have the same care for one another.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_12_26" data-osis="1Cor.12.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span>When one member suffers, all the members suffer with it. Or when one member is honored, all the members rejoice with it.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse 1Cor_12_27" data-osis="1Cor.12.27"><span class="verse-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span>Now you are the body of Christ, and members individually.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_12_28" data-osis="1Cor.12.28"><span class="verse-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span>God has set some in the assembly: first apostles, second prophets, third teachers, then miracle workers, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, and various kinds of languages.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_12_29" data-osis="1Cor.12.29"><span class="verse-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span>Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Are all miracle workers?</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_12_30" data-osis="1Cor.12.30"><span class="verse-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span>Do all have gifts of healings? Do all speak with various languages? Do all interpret?</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_12_31" data-osis="1Cor.12.31"><span class="verse-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span>But earnestly desire the best gifts. Moreover, I show a most excellent way to you.</span>

<span class="verse 1Cor_16_1" data-osis="1Cor.16.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I commanded the assemblies of Galatia, you do likewise.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_16_2" data-osis="1Cor.16.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>On the first day of the week, let each one of you save, as he may prosper, that no collections be made when I come.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_16_3" data-osis="1Cor.16.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>When I arrive, I will send whoever you approve with letters to carry your gracious gift to Jerusalem.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_16_4" data-osis="1Cor.16.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>If it is appropriate for me to go also, they will go with me.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_16_5" data-osis="1Cor.16.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>But I will come to you when I have passed through Macedonia, for I am passing through Macedonia.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_16_6" data-osis="1Cor.16.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>But with you it may be that I will stay, or even winter, that you may send me on my journey wherever I go.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_16_7" data-osis="1Cor.16.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>For I do not wish to see you now in passing, but I hope to stay a while with you, if the Lord permits.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_16_8" data-osis="1Cor.16.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>But I will stay at Ephesus until Pentecost,</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_16_9" data-osis="1Cor.16.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>for a great and effective door has opened to me, and there are many adversaries.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_16_10" data-osis="1Cor.16.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>Now if Timothy comes, see that he is with you without fear, for he does the work of the Lord, as I also do.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_16_11" data-osis="1Cor.16.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>Therefore let no one despise him. But set him forward on his journey in peace, that he may come to me; for I expect him with the brothers.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse 1Cor_16_12" data-osis="1Cor.16.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>Now concerning Apollos, the brother, I strongly urged him to come to you with the brothers; and it was not at all his desire to come now; but he will come when he has an opportunity.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse 1Cor_16_13" data-osis="1Cor.16.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>Watch! Stand firm in the faith! Be courageous! Be strong!</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_16_14" data-osis="1Cor.16.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>Let all that you do be done in love.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse 1Cor_16_15" data-osis="1Cor.16.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>Now I beg you, brothers (you know the house of Stephanas, that it is the first fruits of Achaia, and that they have set themselves to serve the saints),</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_16_16" data-osis="1Cor.16.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>that you also be in subjection to such, and to everyone who helps in the work and labors.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_16_17" data-osis="1Cor.16.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>I rejoice at the coming of Stephanas, Fortunatus, and Achaicus; for that which was lacking on your part, they supplied.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_16_18" data-osis="1Cor.16.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>For they refreshed my spirit and yours. Therefore acknowledge those who are like that.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse 1Cor_16_19" data-osis="1Cor.16.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>The assemblies of Asia greet you. Aquila and Priscilla greet you much in the Lord, together with the assembly that is in their house.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_16_20" data-osis="1Cor.16.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>All the brothers greet you. Greet one another with a holy kiss.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse 1Cor_16_21" data-osis="1Cor.16.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>This greeting is by me, Paul, with my own hand.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_16_22" data-osis="1Cor.16.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>If any man doesn&rsquo;t love the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be accursed. <span class="note">+<dfn>Greek: anathema.</dfn></span> Come, Lord!<span class="note">+<dfn>Aramaic: Maranatha!</dfn></span></span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_16_23" data-osis="1Cor.16.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with you.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_16_24" data-osis="1Cor.16.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span>My love to all of you in Christ Jesus. Amen.</span>

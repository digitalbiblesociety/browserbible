<span class="verse 1Cor_2_1" data-osis="1Cor.2.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>When I came to you, brothers, I didn&rsquo;t come with excellence of speech or of wisdom, proclaiming to you the testimony of God.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_2_2" data-osis="1Cor.2.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>For I determined not to know anything among you, except Jesus Christ, and him crucified.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_2_3" data-osis="1Cor.2.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>I was with you in weakness, in fear, and in much trembling.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_2_4" data-osis="1Cor.2.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>My speech and my preaching were not in persuasive words of human wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power,</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_2_5" data-osis="1Cor.2.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>that your faith wouldn&rsquo;t stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_2_6" data-osis="1Cor.2.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>We speak wisdom, however, among those who are full grown; yet a wisdom not of this world, nor of the rulers of this world, who are coming to nothing.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_2_7" data-osis="1Cor.2.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>But we speak God&rsquo;s wisdom in a mystery, the wisdom that has been hidden, which God foreordained before the worlds for our glory,</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_2_8" data-osis="1Cor.2.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>which none of the rulers of this world has known. For had they known it, they wouldn&rsquo;t have crucified the Lord of glory.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_2_9" data-osis="1Cor.2.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>But as it is written,<br /> &ldquo;Things which an eye didn&rsquo;t see, and an ear didn&rsquo;t hear,<br /> which didn&rsquo;t enter into the heart of man,<br /> these God has prepared for those who love him.&rdquo;<span class="cf"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">Isaiah 64:4</span></span> </span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse 1Cor_2_10" data-osis="1Cor.2.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>But to us, God revealed them through the Spirit. For the Spirit searches all things, yes, the deep things of God.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_2_11" data-osis="1Cor.2.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>For who among men knows the things of a man, except the spirit of the man, which is in him? Even so, no one knows the things of God, except God&rsquo;s Spirit.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_2_12" data-osis="1Cor.2.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>But we received, not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit which is from God, that we might know the things that were freely given to us by God.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_2_13" data-osis="1Cor.2.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>Which things also we speak, not in words which man&rsquo;s wisdom teaches, but which the Holy Spirit teaches, comparing spiritual things with spiritual things.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_2_14" data-osis="1Cor.2.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>Now the natural man doesn&rsquo;t receive the things of God&rsquo;s Spirit, for they are foolishness to him, and he can&rsquo;t know them, because they are spiritually discerned.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_2_15" data-osis="1Cor.2.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>But he who is spiritual discerns all things, and he himself is judged by no one.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_2_16" data-osis="1Cor.2.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;For who has known the mind of the Lord, that he should instruct him?&rdquo;<span class="cf"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">Isaiah 40:13</span></span>  But we have Christ&rsquo;s mind.</span>

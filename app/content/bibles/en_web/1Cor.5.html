<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.5.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>You are puffed up, and didn&rsquo;t rather mourn, that he who had done this deed might be removed from among you.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.5.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>For I most certainly, as being absent in body but present in spirit, have already, as though I were present, judged him who has done this thing.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.5.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, you being gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.5.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>are to deliver such a one to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.5.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>Your boasting is not good. Don&rsquo;t you know that a little yeast leavens the whole lump?</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.5.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>Purge out the old yeast, that you may be a new lump, even as you are unleavened. For indeed Christ, our Passover, has been sacrificed in our place.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.5.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old yeast, neither with the yeast of malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.5.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>I wrote to you in my letter to have no company with sexual sinners;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.5.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>yet not at all meaning with the sexual sinners of this world, or with the covetous and extortionists, or with idolaters; for then you would have to leave the world.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.5.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>But as it is, I wrote to you not to associate with anyone who is called a brother who is a sexual sinner, or covetous, or an idolater, or a slanderer, or a drunkard, or an extortionist. Don&rsquo;t even eat with such a person.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.5.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>For what have I to do with also judging those who are outside? Don&rsquo;t you judge those who are within?</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.5.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>But those who are outside, God judges. &ldquo;Put away the wicked man from among yourselves.&rdquo;\x + Deuteronomy 17:7; 19:19; 21:21; 22:21; 24:7\x*</span>

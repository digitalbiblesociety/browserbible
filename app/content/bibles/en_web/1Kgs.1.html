<span class="verse 1Kgs_1_1" data-osis="1Kgs.1.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>Now king David was old and stricken in years; and they covered him with clothes, but he couldn&rsquo;t keep warm.</span>
<span class="verse 1Kgs_1_2" data-osis="1Kgs.1.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>Therefore his servants said to him, &ldquo;Let there be sought for my lord the king a young virgin. Let her stand before the king, and cherish him; and let her lie in your bosom, that my lord the king may keep warm.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse 1Kgs_1_3" data-osis="1Kgs.1.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>So they sought for a beautiful young lady throughout all the borders of Israel, and found Abishag the Shunammite, and brought her to the king.</span>
<span class="verse 1Kgs_1_4" data-osis="1Kgs.1.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>The young lady was very beautiful; and she cherished the king, and ministered to him; but the king didn&rsquo;t know her intimately.</span>
<span class="verse 1Kgs_1_5" data-osis="1Kgs.1.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>Then Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself, saying, &ldquo;I will be king.&rdquo; Then he prepared him chariots and horsemen, and fifty men to run before him.</span>
<span class="verse 1Kgs_1_6" data-osis="1Kgs.1.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>His father had not displeased him at any time in saying, &ldquo;Why have you done so?&rdquo; and he was also a very handsome man; and he was born after Absalom.</span>
<span class="verse 1Kgs_1_7" data-osis="1Kgs.1.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>He conferred with Joab the son of Zeruiah, and with Abiathar the priest: and they following Adonijah helped him.</span>
<span class="verse 1Kgs_1_8" data-osis="1Kgs.1.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>But Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and Nathan the prophet, and Shimei, and Rei, and the mighty men who belonged to David, were not with Adonijah.</span>
<span class="verse 1Kgs_1_9" data-osis="1Kgs.1.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>Adonijah killed sheep and cattle and fatlings by the stone of Zoheleth, which is beside En Rogel; and he called all his brothers, the king&rsquo;s sons, and all the men of Judah, the king&rsquo;s servants:</span>
<span class="verse 1Kgs_1_10" data-osis="1Kgs.1.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>but Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah, and the mighty men, and Solomon his brother, he didn&rsquo;t call.</span>
<span class="verse 1Kgs_1_11" data-osis="1Kgs.1.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>Then Nathan spoke to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon, saying, &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith reigns, and David our lord doesn&rsquo;t know it?</span>
<span class="verse 1Kgs_1_12" data-osis="1Kgs.1.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>Now therefore come, please let me give you counsel, that you may save your own life, and the life of your son Solomon.</span>
<span class="verse 1Kgs_1_13" data-osis="1Kgs.1.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>Go in to king David, and tell him, &lsquo;Didn&rsquo;t you, my lord, king, swear to your handmaid, saying, Assuredly Solomon your son shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne? Why then does Adonijah reign?&rsquo;</span>
<span class="verse 1Kgs_1_14" data-osis="1Kgs.1.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>Behold,<span class="note"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">&ldquo;Behold,&rdquo; from &ldquo;הִנֵּה&rdquo;, means look at, take notice, observe, see, or gaze at. It is often used as an interjection.</span></span>  while you yet talk there with the king, I also will come in after you, and confirm your words.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse 1Kgs_1_15" data-osis="1Kgs.1.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>Bathsheba went in to the king into the room. The king was very old; and Abishag the Shunammite was ministering to the king.</span>
<span class="verse 1Kgs_1_16" data-osis="1Kgs.1.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>Bathsheba bowed, and showed respect to the king. The king said, &ldquo;What would you like?&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse 1Kgs_1_17" data-osis="1Kgs.1.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>She said to him, &ldquo;My lord, you swore by Yahweh<span class="note"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">&ldquo;Yahweh&rdquo; is God&rsquo;s proper Name, sometimes rendered &ldquo;LORD&rdquo; (all caps) in other translations.</span></span>  your God<span class="note"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">The Hebrew word rendered &ldquo;God&rdquo; is &ldquo;Elohim.&rdquo;</span></span>  to your handmaid, &lsquo;Assuredly Solomon your son shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne.&rsquo;</span>
<span class="verse 1Kgs_1_18" data-osis="1Kgs.1.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>Now, behold, Adonijah reigns; and you, my lord the king, don&rsquo;t know it.</span>
<span class="verse 1Kgs_1_19" data-osis="1Kgs.1.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>He has slain cattle and fatlings and sheep in abundance, and has called all the sons of the king, and Abiathar the priest, and Joab the captain of the army; but he hasn&rsquo;t called Solomon your servant.</span>
<span class="verse 1Kgs_1_20" data-osis="1Kgs.1.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>You, my lord the king, the eyes of all Israel are on you, that you should tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him.</span>
<span class="verse 1Kgs_1_21" data-osis="1Kgs.1.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>Otherwise it will happen, when my lord the king shall sleep with his fathers, that I and my son Solomon shall be counted offenders.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse 1Kgs_1_22" data-osis="1Kgs.1.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>Behold, while she yet talked with the king, Nathan the prophet came in.</span>
<span class="verse 1Kgs_1_23" data-osis="1Kgs.1.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>They told the king, saying, &ldquo;Behold, Nathan the prophet!&rdquo;<br>When he had come in before the king, he bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground.</span>
<span class="verse 1Kgs_1_24" data-osis="1Kgs.1.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span>Nathan said, &ldquo;My lord, king, have you said, &lsquo;Adonijah shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne?&rsquo;</span>
<span class="verse 1Kgs_1_25" data-osis="1Kgs.1.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span>For he is gone down this day, and has slain cattle and fatlings and sheep in abundance, and has called all the king&rsquo;s sons, and the captains of the army, and Abiathar the priest. Behold, they are eating and drinking before him, and say, &lsquo;Long live king Adonijah!&rsquo;</span>
<span class="verse 1Kgs_1_26" data-osis="1Kgs.1.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span>But he hasn&rsquo;t called me, even me your servant, and Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and your servant Solomon.</span>
<span class="verse 1Kgs_1_27" data-osis="1Kgs.1.27"><span class="verse-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span>Is this thing done by my lord the king, and you haven&rsquo;t shown to your servants who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him?&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse 1Kgs_1_28" data-osis="1Kgs.1.28"><span class="verse-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span>Then king David answered, &ldquo;Call to me Bathsheba.&rdquo; She came into the king&rsquo;s presence, and stood before the king.</span>
<span class="verse 1Kgs_1_29" data-osis="1Kgs.1.29"><span class="verse-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span>The king swore, and said, &ldquo;As Yahweh lives, who has redeemed my soul out of all adversity,</span>
<span class="verse 1Kgs_1_30" data-osis="1Kgs.1.30"><span class="verse-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span>most certainly as I swore to you by Yahweh, the God of Israel, saying, &lsquo;Assuredly Solomon your son shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne in my place;&rsquo; most certainly so will I do this day.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse 1Kgs_1_31" data-osis="1Kgs.1.31"><span class="verse-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span>Then Bathsheba bowed with her face to the earth, and showed respect to the king, and said, &ldquo;Let my lord king David live forever!&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse 1Kgs_1_32" data-osis="1Kgs.1.32"><span class="verse-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span>King David said, &ldquo;Call to me Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada.&rdquo; They came before the king.</span>
<span class="verse 1Kgs_1_33" data-osis="1Kgs.1.33"><span class="verse-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span>The king said to them, &ldquo;Take with you the servants of your lord, and cause Solomon my son to ride on my own mule, and bring him down to Gihon.</span>
<span class="verse 1Kgs_1_34" data-osis="1Kgs.1.34"><span class="verse-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span>Let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him there king over Israel. Blow the trumpet, and say, &lsquo;Long live king Solomon!&rsquo;</span>
<span class="verse 1Kgs_1_35" data-osis="1Kgs.1.35"><span class="verse-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span>Then you shall come up after him, and he shall come and sit on my throne; for he shall be king in my place. I have appointed him to be prince over Israel and over Judah.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse 1Kgs_1_36" data-osis="1Kgs.1.36"><span class="verse-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span>Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king, and said, &ldquo;Amen. May Yahweh, the God of my lord the king, say so.</span>
<span class="verse 1Kgs_1_37" data-osis="1Kgs.1.37"><span class="verse-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span>As Yahweh has been with my lord the king, even so may he be with Solomon, and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord king David.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse 1Kgs_1_38" data-osis="1Kgs.1.38"><span class="verse-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span>So Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites, went down, and caused Solomon to ride on king David&rsquo;s mule, and brought him to Gihon.</span>
<span class="verse 1Kgs_1_39" data-osis="1Kgs.1.39"><span class="verse-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span>Zadok the priest took the horn of oil from the Tent, and anointed Solomon. They blew the trumpet; and all the people said, &ldquo;Long live king Solomon!&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse 1Kgs_1_40" data-osis="1Kgs.1.40"><span class="verse-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span>All the people came up after him, and the people piped with pipes, and rejoiced with great joy, so that the earth shook with their sound.</span>
<span class="verse 1Kgs_1_41" data-osis="1Kgs.1.41"><span class="verse-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span>Adonijah and all the guests who were with him heard it as they had made an end of eating. When Joab heard the sound of the trumpet, he said, &ldquo;Why is this noise of the city being in an uproar?&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse 1Kgs_1_42" data-osis="1Kgs.1.42"><span class="verse-num v-42">42&nbsp;</span>While he yet spoke, behold, Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest came: and Adonijah said, &ldquo;Come in; for you are a worthy man, and bring good news.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse 1Kgs_1_43" data-osis="1Kgs.1.43"><span class="verse-num v-43">43&nbsp;</span>Jonathan answered Adonijah, &ldquo;Most certainly our lord king David has made Solomon king.</span>
<span class="verse 1Kgs_1_44" data-osis="1Kgs.1.44"><span class="verse-num v-44">44&nbsp;</span>The king has sent with him Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and they have caused him to ride on the king&rsquo;s mule.</span>
<span class="verse 1Kgs_1_45" data-osis="1Kgs.1.45"><span class="verse-num v-45">45&nbsp;</span>Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king in Gihon. They have come up from there rejoicing, so that the city rang again. This is the noise that you have heard.</span>
<span class="verse 1Kgs_1_46" data-osis="1Kgs.1.46"><span class="verse-num v-46">46&nbsp;</span>Also, Solomon sits on the throne of the kingdom.</span>
<span class="verse 1Kgs_1_47" data-osis="1Kgs.1.47"><span class="verse-num v-47">47&nbsp;</span>Moreover the king&rsquo;s servants came to bless our lord king David, saying, &lsquo;May your God make the name of Solomon better than your name, and make his throne greater than your throne;&rsquo; and the king bowed himself on the bed.</span>
<span class="verse 1Kgs_1_48" data-osis="1Kgs.1.48"><span class="verse-num v-48">48&nbsp;</span>Also thus said the king, &lsquo;Blessed be Yahweh, the God of Israel, who has given one to sit on my throne this day, my eyes even seeing it.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse 1Kgs_1_49" data-osis="1Kgs.1.49"><span class="verse-num v-49">49&nbsp;</span>All the guests of Adonijah were afraid, and rose up, and each man went his way.</span>
<span class="verse 1Kgs_1_50" data-osis="1Kgs.1.50"><span class="verse-num v-50">50&nbsp;</span>Adonijah feared because of Solomon; and he arose, and went, and caught hold on the horns of the altar.</span>
<span class="verse 1Kgs_1_51" data-osis="1Kgs.1.51"><span class="verse-num v-51">51&nbsp;</span>It was told Solomon, saying, &ldquo;Behold, Adonijah fears king Solomon; for, behold, he has laid hold on the horns of the altar, saying, &lsquo;Let king Solomon swear to me first that he will not kill his servant with the sword.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse 1Kgs_1_52" data-osis="1Kgs.1.52"><span class="verse-num v-52">52&nbsp;</span>Solomon said, &ldquo;If he shows himself a worthy man, not a hair of him shall fall to the earth; but if wickedness be found in him, he shall die.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse 1Kgs_1_53" data-osis="1Kgs.1.53"><span class="verse-num v-53">53&nbsp;</span>So king Solomon sent, and they brought him down from the altar. He came and bowed down to king Solomon; and Solomon said to him, &ldquo;Go to your house.&rdquo;</span>

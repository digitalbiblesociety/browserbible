<span class="verse 1Kgs_15_3" data-osis="1Kgs.15.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>He walked in all the sins of his father, which he had done before him; and his heart was not perfect with Yahweh his God, as the heart of David his father.</span>
<span class="verse 1Kgs_15_4" data-osis="1Kgs.15.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>Nevertheless for David&rsquo;s sake, Yahweh his God gave him a lamp in Jerusalem, to set up his son after him, and to establish Jerusalem;</span>
<span class="verse 1Kgs_15_5" data-osis="1Kgs.15.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>because David did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh, and didn&rsquo;t turn aside from anything that he commanded him all the days of his life, except only in the matter of Uriah the Hittite.</span>
<span class="verse 1Kgs_15_6" data-osis="1Kgs.15.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>Now there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the days of his life.</span>
<span class="verse 1Kgs_15_7" data-osis="1Kgs.15.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>The rest of the acts of Abijam, and all that he did, aren&rsquo;t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? There was war between Abijam and Jeroboam.</span>
<span class="verse 1Kgs_15_8" data-osis="1Kgs.15.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>Abijam slept with his fathers; and they buried him in the city of David: and Asa his son reigned in his place.</span>

<span class="verse 1Kgs_15_11" data-osis="1Kgs.15.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>Asa did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh, as did David his father.</span>
<span class="verse 1Kgs_15_12" data-osis="1Kgs.15.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>He put away the sodomites out of the land, and removed all the idols that his fathers had made.</span>
<span class="verse 1Kgs_15_13" data-osis="1Kgs.15.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>Also Maacah his mother he removed from being queen, because she had made an abominable image for an Asherah; and Asa cut down her image, and burnt it at the brook Kidron.</span>
<span class="verse 1Kgs_15_14" data-osis="1Kgs.15.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>But the high places were not taken away: nevertheless the heart of Asa was perfect with Yahweh all his days.</span>
<span class="verse 1Kgs_15_15" data-osis="1Kgs.15.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>He brought into the house of Yahweh the things that his father had dedicated, and the things that himself had dedicated, silver, and gold, and vessels.</span>

<span class="verse 1Kgs_15_17" data-osis="1Kgs.15.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah, and built Ramah, that he might not allow anyone to go out or come in to Asa king of Judah.</span>
<span class="verse 1Kgs_15_18" data-osis="1Kgs.15.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>Then Asa took all the silver and the gold that were left in the treasures of the house of Yahweh, and the treasures of the king&rsquo;s house, and delivered them into the hand of his servants; and king Asa sent them to Ben Hadad, the son of Tabrimmon, the son of Hezion, king of Syria, who lived at Damascus, saying,</span>
<span class="verse 1Kgs_15_19" data-osis="1Kgs.15.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;There is a treaty between me and you, between my father and your father.

<p>
<span class="verse 1Kgs_15_20" data-osis="1Kgs.15.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>Ben Hadad listened to king Asa, and sent the captains of his armies against the cities of Israel, and struck Ijon, and Dan, and Abel Beth Maacah, and all Chinneroth, with all the land of Naphtali.</span>
<span class="verse 1Kgs_15_21" data-osis="1Kgs.15.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>It happened, when Baasha heard of it, that he left off building Ramah, and lived in Tirzah.</span>
<span class="verse 1Kgs_15_22" data-osis="1Kgs.15.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>Then king Asa made a proclamation to all Judah; no one was exempted: and they carried away the stones of Ramah, and its timber, with which Baasha had built; and king Asa built therewith Geba of Benjamin, and Mizpah.</span>
<span class="verse 1Kgs_15_23" data-osis="1Kgs.15.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>Now the rest of all the acts of Asa, and all his might, and all that he did, and the cities which he built, aren&rsquo;t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? But in the time of his old age he was diseased in his feet.</span>
<span class="verse 1Kgs_15_24" data-osis="1Kgs.15.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span>Asa slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father; and Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his place.</span>

<span class="verse 1Kgs_15_27" data-osis="1Kgs.15.27"><span class="verse-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span>Baasha the son of Ahijah, of the house of Issachar, conspired against him; and Baasha struck him at Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines; for Nadab and all Israel were laying siege to Gibbethon.</span>
<span class="verse 1Kgs_15_28" data-osis="1Kgs.15.28"><span class="verse-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span>Even in the third year of Asa king of Judah, Baasha killed him, and reigned in his place.</span>
<span class="verse 1Kgs_15_29" data-osis="1Kgs.15.29"><span class="verse-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span>It happened that, as soon as he was king, he struck all the house of Jeroboam: he didn&rsquo;t leave to Jeroboam any who breathed, until he had destroyed him; according to the saying of Yahweh, which he spoke by his servant Ahijah the Shilonite;</span>
<span class="verse 1Kgs_15_30" data-osis="1Kgs.15.30"><span class="verse-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span>for the sins of Jeroboam which he sinned, and with which he made Israel to sin, because of his provocation with which he provoked Yahweh, the God of Israel, to anger.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Kgs.17.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>Elijah the Tishbite, who was of the foreigners of Gilead, said to Ahab, &ldquo;As Yahweh, the God of Israel, lives, before whom I stand, there shall not be dew nor rain these years, but according to my word.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Kgs.17.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>The word of Yahweh came to him, saying,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Kgs.17.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Go away from here, turn eastward, and hide yourself by the brook Cherith, that is before the Jordan.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Kgs.17.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>It shall be, that you shall drink of the brook. I have commanded the ravens to feed you there.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Kgs.17.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>So he went and did according to the word of Yahweh; for he went and lived by the brook Cherith, that is before the Jordan.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Kgs.17.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>The ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning, and bread and flesh in the evening; and he drank of the brook.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Kgs.17.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>It happened after a while, that the brook dried up, because there was no rain in the land.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Kgs.17.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>The word of Yahweh came to him, saying,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Kgs.17.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Arise, go to Zarephath, which belongs to Sidon, and stay there. Behold, I have commanded a widow there to sustain you.&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="1Kgs.17.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>So he arose and went to Zarephath; and when he came to the gate of the city, behold, a widow was there gathering sticks: and he called to her, and said, &ldquo;Please get me a little water in a vessel, that I may drink.&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="1Kgs.17.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>As she was going to get it, he called to her, and said, &ldquo;Please bring me a morsel of bread in your hand.&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="1Kgs.17.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>She said, &ldquo;As Yahweh your God lives, I don&rsquo;t have a cake, but a handful of meal in the jar, and a little oil in the jar. Behold, I am gathering two sticks, that I may go in and bake it for me and my son, that we may eat it, and die.&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="1Kgs.17.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>Elijah said to her, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid. Go and do as you have said; but make me of it a little cake first, and bring it out to me, and afterward make some for you and for your son.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Kgs.17.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>For thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, &lsquo;The jar of meal shall not empty, neither shall the jar of oil fail, until the day that Yahweh sends rain on the earth.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="1Kgs.17.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>She went and did according to the saying of Elijah: and she, and he, and her house, ate many days.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Kgs.17.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span>The jar of meal didn&rsquo;t empty, neither did the jar of oil fail, according to the word of Yahweh, which he spoke by Elijah.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Kgs.17.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span>It happened after these things, that the son of the woman, the mistress of the house, fell sick; and his sickness was so severe, that there was no breath left in him.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Kgs.17.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span>She said to Elijah, &ldquo;What have I to do with you, you man of God? You have come to me to bring my sin to memory, and to kill my son!&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="1Kgs.17.19"><span class="verse-num">19&nbsp;</span>He said to her, &ldquo;Give me your son.&rdquo; He took him out of her bosom, and carried him up into the room where he stayed, and laid him on his own bed.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Kgs.17.20"><span class="verse-num">20&nbsp;</span>He cried to Yahweh, and said, &ldquo;Yahweh my God, have you also brought evil on the widow with whom I stay, by killing her son?&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="1Kgs.17.21"><span class="verse-num">21&nbsp;</span>He stretched himself on the child three times, and cried to Yahweh, and said, &ldquo;Yahweh my God, please let this child&rsquo;s soul come into him again.&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="1Kgs.17.22"><span class="verse-num">22&nbsp;</span>Yahweh listened to the voice of Elijah; and the soul of the child came into him again, and he revived.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Kgs.17.23"><span class="verse-num">23&nbsp;</span>Elijah took the child, and brought him down out of the room into the house, and delivered him to his mother; and Elijah said, &ldquo;Behold, your son lives.&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="1Kgs.17.24"><span class="verse-num">24&nbsp;</span>The woman said to Elijah, &ldquo;Now I know that you are a man of God, and that the word of Yahweh in your mouth is truth.&rdquo;</span>

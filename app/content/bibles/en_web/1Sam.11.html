<span class="verse" data-osis="1Sam.11.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>Nahash the Ammonite said to them, &ldquo;On this condition I will make it with you, that all your right eyes be put out; and I will lay it for a reproach on all Israel.&rdquo;</span>

<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="1Sam.11.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>The elders of Jabesh said to him, &ldquo;Give us seven days, that we may send messengers to all the borders of Israel; and then, if there is no one to save us, we will come out to you.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Sam.11.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>Then the messengers came to Gibeah of Saul, and spoke these words in the ears of the people: and all the people lifted up their voice, and wept.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="1Sam.11.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>Behold, Saul came following the oxen out of the field; and Saul said, &ldquo;What ails the people that they weep?&rdquo; They told him the words of the men of Jabesh.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Sam.11.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>The Spirit of God came mightily on Saul when he heard those words, and his anger was kindled greatly.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Sam.11.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>He took a yoke of oxen, and cut them in pieces, and sent them throughout all the borders of Israel by the hand of messengers, saying, &ldquo;Whoever doesn&rsquo;t come out after Saul and after Samuel, so shall it be done to his oxen.&rdquo; The dread of Yahweh fell on the people, and they came out as one man.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Sam.11.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>He numbered them in Bezek; and the children of Israel were three hundred thousand, and the men of Judah thirty thousand.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Sam.11.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>They said to the messengers who came, &ldquo;Thus you shall tell the men of Jabesh Gilead, &lsquo;Tomorrow, by the time the sun is hot, you shall have deliverance.&rsquo;&rdquo; The messengers came and told the men of Jabesh; and they were glad.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Sam.11.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>Therefore the men of Jabesh said, &ldquo;Tomorrow we will come out to you, and you shall do with us all that seems good to you.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Sam.11.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>It was so on the next day, that Saul put the people in three companies; and they came into the midst of the camp in the morning watch, and struck the Ammonites until the heat of the day: and it happened, that those who remained were scattered, so that no two of them were left together.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Sam.11.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>The people said to Samuel, &ldquo;Who is he who said, &lsquo;Shall Saul reign over us?&rsquo; Bring those men, that we may put them to death!&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="1Sam.11.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>Saul said, &ldquo;There shall not a man be put to death this day; for today Yahweh has worked deliverance in Israel.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Sam.11.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>Then Samuel said to the people, &ldquo;Come, and let us go to Gilgal, and renew the kingdom there.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Sam.11.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>All the people went to Gilgal; and there they made Saul king before Yahweh in Gilgal; and there they offered sacrifices of peace offerings before Yahweh; and there Saul and all the men of Israel rejoiced greatly.</span>

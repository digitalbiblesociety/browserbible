<span class="verse" data-osis="1Sam.16.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>Yahweh said to Samuel, &ldquo;How long will you mourn for Saul, since I have rejected him from being king over Israel? Fill your horn with oil, and go. I will send you to Jesse the Bethlehemite; for I have provided a king for myself among his sons.&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="1Sam.16.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>Samuel said, &ldquo;How can I go? If Saul hears it, he will kill me.&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="1Sam.16.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>Call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will show you what you shall do. You shall anoint to me him whom I name to you.&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="1Sam.16.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>Samuel did that which Yahweh spoke, and came to Bethlehem. The elders of the city came to meet him trembling, and said, &ldquo;Do you come peaceably?&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="1Sam.16.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>He said, &ldquo;Peaceably; I have come to sacrifice to Yahweh. Sanctify yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice.&rdquo; He sanctified Jesse and his sons, and called them to the sacrifice.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Sam.16.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>It happened, when they had come, that he looked at Eliab, and said, &ldquo;Surely Yahweh&rsquo;s anointed is before him.&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="1Sam.16.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>But Yahweh said to Samuel, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t look on his face, or on the height of his stature; because I have rejected him: for I see not as man sees; for man looks at the outward appearance, but Yahweh looks at the heart.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Sam.16.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel. He said, &ldquo;Neither has Yahweh chosen this one.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Sam.16.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>Then Jesse made Shammah to pass by. He said, &ldquo;Neither has Yahweh chosen this one.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Sam.16.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>Jesse made seven of his sons to pass before Samuel. Samuel said to Jesse, &ldquo;Yahweh has not chosen these.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Sam.16.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>Samuel said to Jesse, &ldquo;Are all your children here?&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="1Sam.16.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>He sent, and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, and withal of a beautiful face, and goodly to look on. Yahweh said, &ldquo;Arise, anoint him; for this is he.&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="1Sam.16.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst of his brothers: and the Spirit of Yahweh came mightily on David from that day forward. So Samuel rose up, and went to Ramah.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Sam.16.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>Now the Spirit of Yahweh departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from Yahweh troubled him.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Sam.16.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>Saul&rsquo;s servants said to him, &ldquo;See now, an evil spirit from God troubles you.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Sam.16.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span>Let our lord now command your servants who are before you, to seek out a man who is a skillful player on the harp. It shall happen, when the evil spirit from God is on you, that he shall play with his hand, and you shall be well.&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="1Sam.16.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span>Saul said to his servants, &ldquo;Provide me now a man who can play well, and bring him to me.&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="1Sam.16.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span>Then one of the young men answered, and said, &ldquo;Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite, who is skillful in playing, a mighty man of valor, a man of war, prudent in speech, and a comely person; and Yahweh is with him.&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="1Sam.16.19"><span class="verse-num">19&nbsp;</span>Therefore Saul sent messengers to Jesse, and said, &ldquo;Send me David your son, who is with the sheep.&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="1Sam.16.20"><span class="verse-num">20&nbsp;</span>Jesse took a donkey loaded with bread, and a bottle of wine, and a young goat, and sent them by David his son to Saul.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Sam.16.21"><span class="verse-num">21&nbsp;</span>David came to Saul, and stood before him. He loved him greatly; and he became his armor bearer.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Sam.16.22"><span class="verse-num">22&nbsp;</span>Saul sent to Jesse, saying, &ldquo;Please let David stand before me; for he has found favor in my sight.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Sam.16.23"><span class="verse-num">23&nbsp;</span>It happened, when the spirit from God was on Saul, that David took the harp, and played with his hand: so Saul was refreshed, and was well, and the evil spirit departed from him.</span>

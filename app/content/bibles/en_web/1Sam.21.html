<span class="verse" data-osis="1Sam.21.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>Then came David to Nob to Ahimelech the priest. Ahimelech came to meet David trembling, and said to him, &ldquo;Why are you alone, and no man with you?&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Sam.21.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>David said to Ahimelech the priest, &ldquo;The king has commanded me a business, and has said to me, &lsquo;Let no man know anything of the business about which I send you, and what I have commanded you; and I have appointed the young men to such and such a place.&rsquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Sam.21.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>Now therefore what is under your hand? Give me five loaves of bread in my hand, or whatever there is present.&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="1Sam.21.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>The priest answered David, and said, &ldquo;There is no common bread under my hand, but there is holy bread; if only the young men have kept themselves from women.&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="1Sam.21.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>David answered the priest, and said to him, &ldquo;Truly, women have been kept from us about these three days. When I came out, the vessels of the young men were holy, though it was but a common journey. How much more then today shall their vessels be holy?&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Sam.21.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>So the priest gave him holy bread; for there was no bread there but the show bread, that was taken from before Yahweh, to put hot bread in the day when it was taken away.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="1Sam.21.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>Now a certain man of the servants of Saul was there that day, detained before Yahweh; and his name was Doeg the Edomite, the best of the herdsmen who belonged to Saul.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Sam.21.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>David said to Ahimelech, &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t there here under your hand spear or sword? For I have neither brought my sword nor my weapons with me, because the king&rsquo;s business required haste.&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="1Sam.21.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>The priest said, &ldquo;The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom you killed in the valley of Elah, behold, it is here wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod. If you will take that, take it; for there is no other except that here.&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="1Sam.21.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>David arose, and fled that day for fear of Saul, and went to Achish the king of Gath.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Sam.21.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>The servants of Achish said to him, &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t this David the king of the land? Didn&rsquo;t they sing one to another about him in dances, saying, &lsquo;Saul has slain his thousands, David his ten thousands?&rsquo;&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Sam.21.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>David laid up these words in his heart, and was very afraid of Achish the king of Gath.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Sam.21.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>He changed his behavior before them, and pretended to be mad in their hands, and scrabbled on the doors of the gate, and let his spittle fall down on his beard.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Sam.21.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>Then Achish said to his servants, &ldquo;Look, you see the man is mad. Why then have you brought him to me?</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Sam.21.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>Do I lack madmen, that you have brought this fellow to play the madman in my presence? Shall this fellow come into my house?&rdquo;</span>

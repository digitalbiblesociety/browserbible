<span class="verse 1Sam_23_4" data-osis="1Sam.23.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>Then David inquired of Yahweh yet again. Yahweh answered him, and said, &ldquo;Arise, go down to Keilah; for I will deliver the Philistines into your hand.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse 1Sam_23_9" data-osis="1Sam.23.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>David knew that Saul was devising mischief against him; and he said to Abiathar the priest, &ldquo;Bring the ephod here.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse 1Sam_23_10" data-osis="1Sam.23.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>Then David said, &ldquo;O Yahweh, the God of Israel, your servant has surely heard that Saul seeks to come to Keilah, to destroy the city for my sake.</span>
<span class="verse 1Sam_23_11" data-osis="1Sam.23.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>Will the men of Keilah deliver me up into his hand? Will Saul come down, as your servant has heard? Yahweh, the God of Israel, I beg you, tell your servant.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse 1Sam_23_17" data-osis="1Sam.23.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>He said to him, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid; for the hand of Saul my father shall not find you; and you shall be king over Israel, and I shall be next to you; and that also Saul my father knows.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse 1Sam_23_18" data-osis="1Sam.23.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>They both made a covenant before Yahweh: and David stayed in the woods, and Jonathan went to his house.</span>

<span class="verse 1Sam_23_23" data-osis="1Sam.23.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>See therefore, and take knowledge of all the lurking places where he hides himself, and come again to me with certainty, and I will go with you: and it shall happen, if he is in the land, that I will search him out among all the thousands of Judah.&rdquo;</span>

<p>
<span class="verse 1Sam_23_24" data-osis="1Sam.23.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span>They arose, and went to Ziph before Saul: but David and his men were in the wilderness of Maon, in the Arabah on the south of the desert.</span>
<span class="verse 1Sam_23_25" data-osis="1Sam.23.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span>Saul and his men went to seek him. When David was told, he went down to the rock, and stayed in the wilderness of Maon. When Saul heard that, he pursued David in the wilderness of Maon.</span>
<span class="verse 1Sam_23_26" data-osis="1Sam.23.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span>Saul went on this side of the mountain, and David and his men on that side of the mountain: and David made haste to get away for fear of Saul; for Saul and his men surrounded David and his men to take them.</span>
<span class="verse 1Sam_23_27" data-osis="1Sam.23.27"><span class="verse-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span>But a messenger came to Saul, saying, &ldquo;Hurry and come; for the Philistines have made a raid on the land!&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse 1Sam_23_28" data-osis="1Sam.23.28"><span class="verse-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span>So Saul returned from pursuing after David, and went against the Philistines: therefore they called that place Sela Hammahlekoth.</span>

<span class="verse 1Sam_30_1" data-osis="1Sam.30.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>It happened, when David and his men had come to Ziklag on the third day, that the Amalekites had made a raid on the South, and on Ziklag, and had struck Ziklag, and burned it with fire,</span>
<span class="verse 1Sam_30_2" data-osis="1Sam.30.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>and had taken captive the women and all who were therein, both small and great. They didn&rsquo;t kill any, but carried them off, and went their way.</span>
<span class="verse 1Sam_30_3" data-osis="1Sam.30.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>When David and his men came to the city, behold, it was burned with fire; and their wives, and their sons, and their daughters, were taken captive.</span>
<span class="verse 1Sam_30_4" data-osis="1Sam.30.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>Then David and the people who were with him lifted up their voice and wept, until they had no more power to weep.</span>
<span class="verse 1Sam_30_5" data-osis="1Sam.30.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>David&rsquo;s two wives were taken captive, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite.</span>
<span class="verse 1Sam_30_6" data-osis="1Sam.30.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>David was greatly distressed; for the people spoke of stoning him, because the soul of all the people was grieved, every man for his sons and for his daughters: but David strengthened himself in Yahweh his God.</span>
<span class="verse 1Sam_30_7" data-osis="1Sam.30.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>David said to Abiathar the priest, the son of Ahimelech, &ldquo;Please bring me here the ephod.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse 1Sam_30_8" data-osis="1Sam.30.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>David inquired of Yahweh, saying, &ldquo;If I pursue after this troop, shall I overtake them?&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse 1Sam_30_9" data-osis="1Sam.30.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>So David went, he and the six hundred men who were with him, and came to the brook Besor, where those who were left behind stayed.</span>
<span class="verse 1Sam_30_10" data-osis="1Sam.30.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>But David pursued, he and four hundred men; for two hundred stayed behind, who were so faint that they couldn&rsquo;t go over the brook Besor.</span>
<span class="verse 1Sam_30_11" data-osis="1Sam.30.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>They found an Egyptian in the field, and brought him to David, and gave him bread, and he ate; and they gave him water to drink.</span>
<span class="verse 1Sam_30_12" data-osis="1Sam.30.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>They gave him a piece of a cake of figs, and two clusters of raisins.

<span class="verse 1Sam_30_13" data-osis="1Sam.30.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>David asked him, &ldquo;To whom do you belong? Where are you from?&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse 1Sam_30_16" data-osis="1Sam.30.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>When he had brought him down, behold, they were spread around over all the ground, eating, drinking, and dancing, because of all the great plunder that they had taken out of the land of the Philistines, and out of the land of Judah.</span>
<span class="verse 1Sam_30_17" data-osis="1Sam.30.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>David struck them from the twilight even to the evening of the next day. Not a man of them escaped from there, except four hundred young men, who rode on camels and fled.</span>
<span class="verse 1Sam_30_18" data-osis="1Sam.30.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>David recovered all that the Amalekites had taken; and David rescued his two wives.</span>

<span class="verse 1Sam_30_20" data-osis="1Sam.30.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>David took all the flocks and the herds, which they drove before those other livestock, and said, &ldquo;This is David&rsquo;s plunder.&rdquo;</span>

<p>
<span class="verse 1Sam_30_21" data-osis="1Sam.30.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>David came to the two hundred men, who were so faint that they could not follow David, whom also they had made to stay at the brook Besor; and they went out to meet David, and to meet the people who were with him.

<span class="verse 1Sam_30_22" data-osis="1Sam.30.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>Then all the wicked men and base fellows, of those who went with David, answered and said, &ldquo;Because they didn&rsquo;t go with us, we will not give them anything of the plunder that we have recovered, except to every man his wife and his children, that he may lead them away, and depart.&rdquo;</span>

<p>
<span class="verse 1Sam_30_23" data-osis="1Sam.30.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>Then David said, &ldquo;You shall not do so, my brothers, with that which Yahweh has given to us, who has preserved us, and delivered the troop that came against us into our hand.</span>
<span class="verse 1Sam_30_24" data-osis="1Sam.30.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span>Who will listen to you in this matter? For as his share is who goes down to the battle, so shall his share be who tarries by the baggage: they shall share alike.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse 1Sam_30_25" data-osis="1Sam.30.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span>It was so from that day forward, that he made it a statute and an ordinance for Israel to this day.</span>

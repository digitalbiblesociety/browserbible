<span class="verse 1Thess_5_2" data-osis="1Thess.5.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>For you yourselves know well that the day of the Lord comes like a thief in the night.</span>
<span class="verse 1Thess_5_3" data-osis="1Thess.5.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>For when they are saying, &ldquo;Peace and safety,&rdquo; then sudden destruction will come on them, like birth pains on a pregnant woman; and they will in no way escape.</span>
<span class="verse 1Thess_5_4" data-osis="1Thess.5.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>But you, brothers, aren&rsquo;t in darkness, that the day should overtake you like a thief.</span>

<span class="verse 1Thess_5_6" data-osis="1Thess.5.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>so then let&rsquo;s not sleep, as the rest do, but let&rsquo;s watch and be sober.</span>
<span class="verse 1Thess_5_7" data-osis="1Thess.5.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>For those who sleep, sleep in the night, and those who are drunk are drunk in the night.</span>
<span class="verse 1Thess_5_8" data-osis="1Thess.5.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>But let us, since we belong to the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love, and, for a helmet, the hope of salvation.</span>
<span class="verse 1Thess_5_9" data-osis="1Thess.5.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>For God didn&rsquo;t appoint us to wrath, but to the obtaining of salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ,</span>
<span class="verse 1Thess_5_10" data-osis="1Thess.5.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with him.</span>

<span class="verse 1Thess_5_14" data-osis="1Thess.5.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>We exhort you, brothers, admonish the disorderly, encourage the faint-hearted, support the weak, be patient toward all.</span>
<span class="verse 1Thess_5_15" data-osis="1Thess.5.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>See that no one returns evil for evil to anyone, but always follow after that which is good, for one another, and for all.</span>

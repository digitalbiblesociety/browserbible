<span class="verse 2Chr_11_1" data-osis="2Chr.11.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>When Rehoboam had come to Jerusalem, he assembled the house of Judah and Benjamin, one hundred eighty thousand chosen men, who were warriors, to fight against Israel, to bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam.</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_11_2" data-osis="2Chr.11.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>But the word of Yahweh came to Shemaiah the man of God, saying,</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_11_3" data-osis="2Chr.11.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Speak to Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all Israel in Judah and Benjamin, saying,</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_11_4" data-osis="2Chr.11.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>&lsquo;Thus says Yahweh, &ldquo;You shall not go up, nor fight against your brothers! Return every man to his house; for this thing is of me.&rdquo;&rsquo;&rdquo; So they listened to the words of Yahweh, and returned from going against Jeroboam.</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_11_5" data-osis="2Chr.11.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>Rehoboam lived in Jerusalem, and built cities for defense in Judah.</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_11_6" data-osis="2Chr.11.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>He built Bethlehem, and Etam, and Tekoa,</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_11_7" data-osis="2Chr.11.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>Beth Zur, and Soco, and Adullam,</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_11_8" data-osis="2Chr.11.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>and Gath, and Mareshah, and Ziph,</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_11_9" data-osis="2Chr.11.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>and Adoraim, and Lachish, and Azekah,</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_11_10" data-osis="2Chr.11.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>and Zorah, and Aijalon, and Hebron, which are in Judah and in Benjamin, fortified cities.</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_11_11" data-osis="2Chr.11.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>He fortified the strongholds, and put captains in them, and stores of food, and oil and wine.</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_11_12" data-osis="2Chr.11.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>He put shields and spears in every city, and made them exceeding strong. Judah and Benjamin belonged to him.</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_11_13" data-osis="2Chr.11.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>The priests and the Levites who were in all Israel resorted to him out of all their border.</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_11_14" data-osis="2Chr.11.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>For the Levites left their suburbs and their possession, and came to Judah and Jerusalem: for Jeroboam and his sons cast them off, that they should not execute the priest&rsquo;s office to Yahweh;</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_11_15" data-osis="2Chr.11.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>and he appointed him priests for the high places, and for the male goats, and for the calves which he had made.</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_11_16" data-osis="2Chr.11.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>After them, out of all the tribes of Israel, such as set their hearts to seek Yahweh, the God of Israel, came to Jerusalem to sacrifice to Yahweh, the God of their fathers.</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_11_17" data-osis="2Chr.11.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>So they strengthened the kingdom of Judah, and made Rehoboam the son of Solomon strong, three years; for they walked three years in the way of David and Solomon.</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_11_18" data-osis="2Chr.11.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>Rehoboam took him a wife, Mahalath the daughter of Jerimoth the son of David, and of Abihail the daughter of Eliab the son of Jesse;</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_11_19" data-osis="2Chr.11.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>and she bore him sons: Jeush, and Shemariah, and Zaham.</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_11_20" data-osis="2Chr.11.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>After her he took Maacah the daughter of Absalom; and she bore him Abijah, and Attai, and Ziza, and Shelomith.</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_11_21" data-osis="2Chr.11.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>Rehoboam loved Maacah the daughter of Absalom above all his wives and his concubines: (for he took eighteen wives, and sixty concubines, and became the father of twenty-eight sons and sixty daughters.)</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_11_22" data-osis="2Chr.11.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>Rehoboam appointed Abijah the son of Maacah to be chief, the prince among his brothers; for he intended to make him king.</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_11_23" data-osis="2Chr.11.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>He dealt wisely, and dispersed of all his sons throughout all the lands of Judah and Benjamin, to every fortified city: and he gave them food in abundance. He sought for them many wives.</span>

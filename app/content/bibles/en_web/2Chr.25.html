<span class="verse 2Chr_25_1" data-osis="2Chr.25.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>Amaziah was twenty-five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem: and his mother&rsquo;s name was Jehoaddan, of Jerusalem.</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_25_2" data-osis="2Chr.25.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>He did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh, but not with a perfect heart.</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_25_3" data-osis="2Chr.25.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>Now it happened, when the kingdom was established to him, that he killed his servants who had killed the king his father.</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_25_4" data-osis="2Chr.25.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>But he didn&rsquo;t put their children to death, but did according to that which is written in the law in the book of Moses, as Yahweh commanded, saying, &ldquo;The fathers shall not die for the children, neither shall the children die for the fathers; but every man shall die for his own sin.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_25_5" data-osis="2Chr.25.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>Moreover Amaziah gathered Judah together, and ordered them according to their fathers&rsquo; houses, under captains of thousands and captains of hundreds, even all Judah and Benjamin: and he numbered them from twenty years old and upward, and found them three hundred thousand chosen men, able to go out to war, who could handle spear and shield.</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_25_6" data-osis="2Chr.25.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>He hired also one hundred thousand mighty men of valor out of Israel for one hundred talents of silver.</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_25_7" data-osis="2Chr.25.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>A man of God came to him, saying, &ldquo;O king, don&rsquo;t let the army of Israel go with you; for Yahweh is not with Israel, with all the children of Ephraim.</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_25_8" data-osis="2Chr.25.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>But if you will go, take action, be strong for the battle. God will overthrow you before the enemy; for God has power to help, and to overthrow.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse 2Chr_25_9" data-osis="2Chr.25.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>Amaziah said to the man of God, &ldquo;But what shall we do for the hundred talents which I have given to the army of Israel?&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse 2Chr_25_10" data-osis="2Chr.25.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>Then Amaziah separated them, the army that had come to him out of Ephraim, to go home again: therefore their anger was greatly kindled against Judah, and they returned home in fierce anger.</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_25_11" data-osis="2Chr.25.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>Amaziah took courage, and led his people out, and went to the Valley of Salt, and struck ten thousand of the children of Seir.</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_25_12" data-osis="2Chr.25.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>The children of Judah carry away ten thousand alive, and brought them to the top of the rock, and threw them down from the top of the rock, so that they all were broken in pieces.</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_25_13" data-osis="2Chr.25.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>But the men of the army whom Amaziah sent back, that they should not go with him to battle, fell on the cities of Judah, from Samaria even to Beth Horon, and struck of them three thousand, and took much plunder.</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_25_14" data-osis="2Chr.25.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>Now it happened, after that Amaziah had come from the slaughter of the Edomites, that he brought the gods of the children of Seir, and set them up to be his gods, and bowed down himself before them, and burned incense to them.</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_25_15" data-osis="2Chr.25.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>Therefore Yahweh&rsquo;s anger was kindled against Amaziah, and he sent to him a prophet, who said to him, &ldquo;Why have you sought after the gods of the people, which have not delivered their own people out of your hand?&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse 2Chr_25_16" data-osis="2Chr.25.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>It happened, as he talked with him, that the king said to him, &ldquo;Have we made you one of the king&rsquo;s counselors? Stop! Why should you be struck down?&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse 2Chr_25_17" data-osis="2Chr.25.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>Then Amaziah king of Judah consulted his advisers, and sent to Joash, the son of Jehoahaz the son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, &ldquo;Come, let us look one another in the face.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse 2Chr_25_18" data-osis="2Chr.25.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>Joash king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, &ldquo;The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that was in Lebanon, saying, &lsquo;Give your daughter to my son as his wife; then a wild animal that was in Lebanon passed by, and trampled down the thistle.</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_25_19" data-osis="2Chr.25.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>You say to yourself that you have struck Edom; and your heart lifts you up to boast. Now stay at home. Why should you meddle with trouble, that you should fall, even you, and Judah with you?&rsquo;&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse 2Chr_25_20" data-osis="2Chr.25.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>But Amaziah would not listen; for it was of God, that he might deliver them into the hand of their enemies, because they had sought after the gods of Edom.</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_25_21" data-osis="2Chr.25.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>So Joash king of Israel went up; and he and Amaziah king of Judah looked one another in the face at Beth Shemesh, which belongs to Judah.</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_25_22" data-osis="2Chr.25.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>Judah was defeated by Israel; and they fled every man to his tent.</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_25_23" data-osis="2Chr.25.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>Joash king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Joash the son of Jehoahaz, at Beth Shemesh, and brought him to Jerusalem, and broke down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim to the corner gate, four hundred cubits.</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_25_24" data-osis="2Chr.25.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span>He took all the gold and silver, and all the vessels that were found in God&rsquo;s house with Obed-Edom, and the treasures of the king&rsquo;s house, the hostages also, and returned to Samaria.</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_25_25" data-osis="2Chr.25.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span>Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived after the death of Joash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel fifteen years.</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_25_26" data-osis="2Chr.25.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span>Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah, first and last, behold, aren&rsquo;t they written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel?</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_25_27" data-osis="2Chr.25.27"><span class="verse-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span>Now from the time that Amaziah turned away from following Yahweh, they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem. He fled to Lachish; but they sent after him to Lachish, and killed him there.</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_25_28" data-osis="2Chr.25.28"><span class="verse-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span>They brought him on horses, and buried him with his fathers in the city of Judah.</span>

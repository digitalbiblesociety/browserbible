<span class="verse 2Chr_30_1" data-osis="2Chr.30.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Judah, and wrote letters also to Ephraim and Manasseh, that they should come to the house of Yahweh at Jerusalem, to keep the Passover to Yahweh, the God of Israel.</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_30_2" data-osis="2Chr.30.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>For the king had taken counsel, and his princes, and all the assembly in Jerusalem, to keep the Passover in the second month.</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_30_3" data-osis="2Chr.30.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>For they could not keep it at that time, because the priests had not sanctified themselves in sufficient number, neither had the people gathered themselves together to Jerusalem.</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_30_4" data-osis="2Chr.30.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>The thing was right in the eyes of the king and of all the assembly.</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_30_5" data-osis="2Chr.30.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>So they established a decree to make proclamation throughout all Israel, from Beersheba even to Dan, that they should come to keep the Passover to Yahweh, the God of Israel, at Jerusalem: for they had not kept it in great numbers in such sort as it is written.</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_30_6" data-osis="2Chr.30.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>So the couriers went with the letters from the king and his princes throughout all Israel and Judah, and according to the commandment of the king, saying, &ldquo;You children of Israel, turn again to Yahweh, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, that he may return to the remnant that have escaped of you out of the hand of the kings of Assyria.</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_30_7" data-osis="2Chr.30.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>Don&rsquo;t be like your fathers, and like your brothers, who trespassed against Yahweh, the God of their fathers, so that he gave them up to desolation, as you see.</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_30_8" data-osis="2Chr.30.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>Now don&rsquo;t be stiff-necked, as your fathers were; but yield yourselves to Yahweh, and enter into his sanctuary, which he has sanctified forever, and serve Yahweh your God, that his fierce anger may turn away from you.</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_30_9" data-osis="2Chr.30.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>For if you turn again to Yahweh, your brothers and your children shall find compassion before those who led them captive, and shall come again into this land: for Yahweh your God is gracious and merciful, and will not turn away his face from you, if you return to him.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse 2Chr_30_10" data-osis="2Chr.30.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>So the couriers passed from city to city through the country of Ephraim and Manasseh, even to Zebulun: but they ridiculed them, and mocked them.</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_30_11" data-osis="2Chr.30.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>Nevertheless certain men of Asher and Manasseh and of Zebulun humbled themselves, and came to Jerusalem.</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_30_12" data-osis="2Chr.30.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>Also on Judah came the hand of God to give them one heart, to do the commandment of the king and of the princes by the word of Yahweh.</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_30_13" data-osis="2Chr.30.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>Many people assembled at Jerusalem to keep the feast of unleavened bread in the second month, a very great assembly.</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_30_14" data-osis="2Chr.30.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>They arose and took away the altars that were in Jerusalem, and all the altars for incense took they away, and cast them into the brook Kidron.</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_30_15" data-osis="2Chr.30.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>Then they killed the Passover on the fourteenth day of the second month: and the priests and the Levites were ashamed, and sanctified themselves, and brought burnt offerings into the house of Yahweh.</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_30_16" data-osis="2Chr.30.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>They stood in their place after their order, according to the law of Moses the man of God: the priests sprinkled the blood which they received of the hand of the Levites.</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_30_17" data-osis="2Chr.30.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>For there were many in the assembly who had not sanctified themselves: therefore the Levites were in charge of killing the Passovers for everyone who was not clean, to sanctify them to Yahweh.</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_30_18" data-osis="2Chr.30.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>For a multitude of the people, even many of Ephraim and Manasseh, Issachar and Zebulun, had not cleansed themselves, yet they ate the Passover otherwise than it is written. For Hezekiah had prayed for them, saying, &ldquo;May the good Yahweh pardon everyone</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_30_19" data-osis="2Chr.30.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>who sets his heart to seek God, Yahweh, the God of his fathers, even if they aren&rsquo;t clean according to the purification of the sanctuary.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse 2Chr_30_20" data-osis="2Chr.30.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>Yahweh listened to Hezekiah, and healed the people.</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_30_21" data-osis="2Chr.30.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>The children of Israel who were present at Jerusalem kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with great gladness; and the Levites and the priests praised Yahweh day by day, singing with loud instruments to Yahweh.</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_30_22" data-osis="2Chr.30.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>Hezekiah spoke comfortably to all the Levites who had good understanding in the service of Yahweh. So they ate throughout the feast for the seven days, offering sacrifices of peace offerings, and making confession to Yahweh, the God of their fathers.</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_30_23" data-osis="2Chr.30.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>The whole assembly took counsel to keep other seven days; and they kept another seven days with gladness.</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_30_24" data-osis="2Chr.30.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span>For Hezekiah king of Judah gave to the assembly for offerings one thousand bulls and seven thousand sheep; and the princes gave to the assembly a thousand bulls and ten thousand sheep: and a great number of priests sanctified themselves.</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_30_25" data-osis="2Chr.30.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span>All the assembly of Judah, with the priests and the Levites, and all the assembly who came out of Israel, and the foreigners who came out of the land of Israel, and who lived in Judah, rejoiced.</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_30_26" data-osis="2Chr.30.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span>So there was great joy in Jerusalem; for since the time of Solomon the son of David king of Israel there was not the like in Jerusalem.</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_30_27" data-osis="2Chr.30.27"><span class="verse-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span>Then the priests the Levites arose and blessed the people: and their voice was heard, and their prayer came up to his holy habitation, even to heaven.</span>

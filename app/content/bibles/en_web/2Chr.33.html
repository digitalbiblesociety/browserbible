<span class="verse 2Chr_33_1" data-osis="2Chr.33.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign; and he reigned fifty-five years in Jerusalem.</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_33_2" data-osis="2Chr.33.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>He did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, after the abominations of the nations whom Yahweh cast out before the children of Israel.</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_33_3" data-osis="2Chr.33.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>For he built again the high places which Hezekiah his father had broken down; and he reared up altars for the Baals, and made Asheroth, and worshiped all the army of the sky, and served them.</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_33_4" data-osis="2Chr.33.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>He built altars in the house of Yahweh, of which Yahweh said, &ldquo;My name shall be in Jerusalem forever.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_33_5" data-osis="2Chr.33.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>He built altars for all the army of the sky in the two courts of the house of Yahweh.</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_33_6" data-osis="2Chr.33.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>He also made his children to pass through the fire in the valley of the son of Hinnom; and he practiced sorcery, and used enchantments, and practiced sorcery, and dealt with those who had familiar spirits, and with wizards: he worked much evil in the sight of Yahweh, to provoke him to anger.</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_33_7" data-osis="2Chr.33.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>He set the engraved image of the idol, which he had made, in God&rsquo;s house, of which God said to David and to Solomon his son, &ldquo;In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, will I put my name forever:</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_33_8" data-osis="2Chr.33.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>neither will I any more remove the foot of Israel from off the land which I have appointed for your fathers, if only they will observe to do all that I have commanded them, even all the law and the statutes and the ordinances given by Moses.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_33_9" data-osis="2Chr.33.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>Manasseh seduced Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that they did more evil than the nations whom Yahweh destroyed before the children of Israel did.</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_33_10" data-osis="2Chr.33.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>Yahweh spoke to Manasseh, and to his people; but they gave no heed.</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_33_11" data-osis="2Chr.33.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>Therefore Yahweh brought on them the captains of the army of the king of Assyria, who took Manasseh in chains, and bound him with fetters, and carried him to Babylon.</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_33_12" data-osis="2Chr.33.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>When he was in distress, he begged Yahweh his God, and humbled himself greatly before the God of his fathers.</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_33_13" data-osis="2Chr.33.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>He prayed to him; and he was entreated by him, and heard his supplication, and brought him again to Jerusalem into his kingdom. Then Manasseh knew that Yahweh was God.</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_33_14" data-osis="2Chr.33.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>Now after this he built an outer wall to the city of David, on the west side of Gihon, in the valley, even to the entrance at the fish gate; and he encircled Ophel with it, and raised it up to a very great height: and he put valiant captains in all the fortified cities of Judah.</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_33_15" data-osis="2Chr.33.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>He took away the foreign gods, and the idol out of the house of Yahweh, and all the altars that he had built in the mountain of the house of Yahweh, and in Jerusalem, and cast them out of the city.</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_33_16" data-osis="2Chr.33.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>He built up the altar of Yahweh, and offered sacrifices of peace offerings and of thanksgiving on it, and commanded Judah to serve Yahweh, the God of Israel.</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_33_17" data-osis="2Chr.33.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>Nevertheless the people sacrificed still in the high places, but only to Yahweh their God.</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_33_18" data-osis="2Chr.33.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and his prayer to his God, and the words of the seers who spoke to him in the name of Yahweh, the God of Israel, behold, they are written among the acts of the kings of Israel.</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_33_19" data-osis="2Chr.33.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>His prayer also, and how God was entreated of him, and all his sin and his trespass, and the places in which he built high places, and set up the Asherah poles and the engraved images, before he humbled himself: behold, they are written in the history of Hozai.</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_33_20" data-osis="2Chr.33.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>So Manasseh slept with his fathers, and they buried him in his own house: and Amon his son reigned in his place.</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_33_21" data-osis="2Chr.33.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>Amon was twenty-two years old when he began to reign; and he reigned two years in Jerusalem.</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_33_22" data-osis="2Chr.33.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>He did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, as did Manasseh his father; and Amon sacrificed to all the engraved images which Manasseh his father had made, and served them.</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_33_23" data-osis="2Chr.33.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>He didn&rsquo;t humble himself before Yahweh, as Manasseh his father had humbled himself; but this same Amon trespassed more and more.</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_33_24" data-osis="2Chr.33.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span>His servants conspired against him, and put him to death in his own house.</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_33_25" data-osis="2Chr.33.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span>But the people of the land killed all those who had conspired against king Amon; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his place.</span>

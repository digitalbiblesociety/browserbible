<span class="verse 2Chr_34_1" data-osis="2Chr.34.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign; and he reigned thirty-one years in Jerusalem.</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_34_2" data-osis="2Chr.34.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>He did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh, and walked in the ways of David his father, and didn&rsquo;t turn aside to the right hand or to the left.</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_34_3" data-osis="2Chr.34.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>For in the eighth year of his reign, while he was yet young, he began to seek after the God of David his father; and in the twelfth year he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem from the high places, and the Asherah poles, and the engraved images, and the molten images.</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_34_4" data-osis="2Chr.34.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>They broke down the altars of the Baals in his presence; and the incense altars that were on high above them he cut down; and the Asherah poles, and the engraved images, and the molten images, he broke in pieces, and made dust of them, and strewed it on the graves of those who had sacrificed to them.</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_34_5" data-osis="2Chr.34.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>He burnt the bones of the priests on their altars, and purged Judah and Jerusalem.</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_34_6" data-osis="2Chr.34.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>He did this in the cities of Manasseh and Ephraim and Simeon, even to Naphtali, around in their ruins.</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_34_7" data-osis="2Chr.34.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>He broke down the altars, and beat the Asherah poles and the engraved images into powder, and cut down all the incense altars throughout all the land of Israel, and returned to Jerusalem.</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_34_8" data-osis="2Chr.34.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>Now in the eighteenth year of his reign, when he had purged the land and the house, he sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, and Maaseiah the governor of the city, and Joah the son of Joahaz the recorder, to repair the house of Yahweh his God.</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_34_9" data-osis="2Chr.34.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>They came to Hilkiah the high priest, and delivered the money that was brought into God&rsquo;s house, which the Levites, the keepers of the threshold, had gathered of the hand of Manasseh and Ephraim, and of all the remnant of Israel, and of all Judah and Benjamin, and of the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_34_10" data-osis="2Chr.34.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>They delivered it into the hand of the workmen who had the oversight of the house of Yahweh; and the workmen who labored in the house of Yahweh gave it to mend and repair the house;</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_34_11" data-osis="2Chr.34.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>even to the carpenters and to the builders gave they it, to buy cut stone, and timber for couplings, and to make beams for the houses which the kings of Judah had destroyed.</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_34_12" data-osis="2Chr.34.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>The men did the work faithfully: and their overseers were Jahath and Obadiah, the Levites, of the sons of Merari; and Zechariah and Meshullam, of the sons of the Kohathites, to set it forward; and others of the Levites, all who were skillful with instruments of music.</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_34_13" data-osis="2Chr.34.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>Also they were over the bearers of burdens, and set forward all who did the work in every kind of service: and of the Levites there were scribes, and officers, and porters.</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_34_14" data-osis="2Chr.34.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>When they brought out the money that was brought into the house of Yahweh, Hilkiah the priest found the book of the law of Yahweh given by Moses.</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_34_15" data-osis="2Chr.34.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>Hilkiah answered Shaphan the scribe, &ldquo;I have found the book of the law in the house of Yahweh.&rdquo; Hilkiah delivered the book to Shaphan.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse 2Chr_34_16" data-osis="2Chr.34.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>Shaphan carried the book to the king, and moreover brought back word to the king, saying, &ldquo;All that was committed to your servants, they are doing.</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_34_17" data-osis="2Chr.34.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>They have emptied out the money that was found in the house of Yahweh, and have delivered it into the hand of the overseers, and into the hand of the workmen.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_34_18" data-osis="2Chr.34.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>Shaphan the scribe told the king, saying, &ldquo;Hilkiah the priest has delivered me a book.&rdquo; Shaphan read therein before the king.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse 2Chr_34_19" data-osis="2Chr.34.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>It happened, when the king had heard the words of the law, that he tore his clothes.</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_34_20" data-osis="2Chr.34.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>The king commanded Hilkiah, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Abdon the son of Micah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah the king&rsquo;s servant, saying,</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_34_21" data-osis="2Chr.34.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Go inquire of Yahweh for me, and for those who are left in Israel and in Judah, concerning the words of the book that is found; for great is the wrath of Yahweh that is poured out on us, because our fathers have not kept the word of Yahweh, to do according to all that is written in this book.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_34_22" data-osis="2Chr.34.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>So Hilkiah, and they whom the king had commanded, went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tokhath, the son of Hasrah, keeper of the wardrobe; (now she lived in Jerusalem in the second quarter;) and they spoke to her to that effect.</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_34_23" data-osis="2Chr.34.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>She said to them, &ldquo;Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel: &lsquo;Tell the man who sent you to me,</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_34_24" data-osis="2Chr.34.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Thus says Yahweh, &lsquo;Behold, I will bring evil on this place, and on its inhabitants, even all the curses that are written in the book which they have read before the king of Judah.</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_34_25" data-osis="2Chr.34.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span>Because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense to other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands; therefore is my wrath poured out on this place, and it shall not be quenched.&rsquo;&rdquo;&rsquo;</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_34_26" data-osis="2Chr.34.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span>But to the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of Yahweh, thus you shall tell him, &lsquo;Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel: &ldquo;As touching the words which you have heard,</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_34_27" data-osis="2Chr.34.27"><span class="verse-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span>because your heart was tender, and you humbled yourself before God, when you heard his words against this place, and against its inhabitants, and have humbled yourself before me, and have torn your clothes, and wept before me; I also have heard you,&rdquo; says Yahweh.</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_34_28" data-osis="2Chr.34.28"><span class="verse-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Behold, I will gather you to your fathers, and you shall be gathered to your grave in peace, neither shall your eyes see all the evil that I will bring on this place, and on its inhabitants.&rdquo;&rsquo;&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse 2Chr_34_29" data-osis="2Chr.34.29"><span class="verse-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span>Then the king sent and gathered together all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem.</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_34_30" data-osis="2Chr.34.30"><span class="verse-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span>The king went up to the house of Yahweh, and all the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the priests, and the Levites, and all the people, both great and small: and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant that was found in the house of Yahweh.</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_34_31" data-osis="2Chr.34.31"><span class="verse-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span>The king stood in his place, and made a covenant before Yahweh, to walk after Yahweh, and to keep his commandments, and his testimonies, and his statutes, with all his heart, and with all his soul, to perform the words of the covenant that were written in this book.</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_34_32" data-osis="2Chr.34.32"><span class="verse-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span>He caused all who were found in Jerusalem and Benjamin to stand. The inhabitants of Jerusalem did according to the covenant of God, the God of their fathers.</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_34_33" data-osis="2Chr.34.33"><span class="verse-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span>Josiah took away all the abominations out of all the countries that pertained to the children of Israel, and made all who were found in Israel to serve, even to serve Yahweh their God. All his days they didn&rsquo;t depart from following Yahweh, the God of their fathers.</span>

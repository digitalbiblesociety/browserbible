<span class="verse 2Cor_10_1" data-osis="2Cor.10.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>Now I Paul, myself, entreat you by the humility and gentleness of Christ; I who in your presence am lowly among you, but being absent am bold toward you.</span>
<span class="verse 2Cor_10_2" data-osis="2Cor.10.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>Yes, I beg you that I may not, when present, show courage with the confidence with which I intend to be bold against some, who consider us to be walking according to the flesh.</span>
<span class="verse 2Cor_10_3" data-osis="2Cor.10.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>For though we walk in the flesh, we don&rsquo;t wage war according to the flesh;</span>
<span class="verse 2Cor_10_4" data-osis="2Cor.10.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>for the weapons of our warfare are not of the flesh, but mighty before God to the throwing down of strongholds,</span>
<span class="verse 2Cor_10_5" data-osis="2Cor.10.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>throwing down imaginations and every high thing that is exalted against the knowledge of God, and bringing every thought into captivity to the obedience of Christ;</span>
<span class="verse 2Cor_10_6" data-osis="2Cor.10.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>and being in readiness to avenge all disobedience, when your obedience will be made full.</span>
<span class="verse 2Cor_10_7" data-osis="2Cor.10.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>Do you look at things only as they appear in front of your face? If anyone trusts in himself that he is Christ&rsquo;s, let him consider this again with himself, that, even as he is Christ&rsquo;s, so also we are Christ&rsquo;s.</span>
<span class="verse 2Cor_10_8" data-osis="2Cor.10.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>For though I should boast somewhat abundantly concerning our authority, (which the Lord gave for building you up, and not for casting you down) I will not be disappointed,</span>
<span class="verse 2Cor_10_9" data-osis="2Cor.10.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>that I may not seem as if I desire to terrify you by my letters.</span>
<span class="verse 2Cor_10_10" data-osis="2Cor.10.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>For, &ldquo;His letters,&rdquo; they say, &ldquo;are weighty and strong, but his bodily presence is weak, and his speech is despised.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse 2Cor_10_11" data-osis="2Cor.10.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>Let such a person consider this, that what we are in word by letters when we are absent, such are we also in deed when we are present.</span>
<span class="verse 2Cor_10_12" data-osis="2Cor.10.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>For we are not bold to number or compare ourselves with some of those who commend themselves. But they themselves, measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves with themselves, are without understanding.</span>
<span class="verse 2Cor_10_13" data-osis="2Cor.10.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>But we will not boast beyond proper limits, but within the boundaries with which God appointed to us, which reach even to you.</span>
<span class="verse 2Cor_10_14" data-osis="2Cor.10.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>For we don&rsquo;t stretch ourselves too much, as though we didn&rsquo;t reach to you. For we came even as far as to you with the Good News of Christ,</span>
<span class="verse 2Cor_10_15" data-osis="2Cor.10.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>not boasting beyond proper limits in other men&rsquo;s labors, but having hope that as your faith grows, we will be abundantly enlarged by you in our sphere of influence,</span>
<span class="verse 2Cor_10_16" data-osis="2Cor.10.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>so as to preach the Good News even to the parts beyond you, not to boast in what someone else has already done.</span>
<span class="verse 2Cor_10_17" data-osis="2Cor.10.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>But &ldquo;he who boasts, let him boast in the Lord.&rdquo;<span class="cf"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">Jeremiah 9:24</span></span> </span>
<span class="verse 2Cor_10_18" data-osis="2Cor.10.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>For it isn&rsquo;t he who commends himself who is approved, but whom the Lord commends.</span>

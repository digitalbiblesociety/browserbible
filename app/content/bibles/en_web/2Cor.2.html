<span class="verse" data-osis="2Cor.2.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>But I determined this for myself, that I would not come to you again in sorrow.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Cor.2.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>For if I make you sorry, then who will make me glad but he who is made sorry by me?</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Cor.2.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>And I wrote this very thing to you, so that, when I came, I wouldn&rsquo;t have sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice; having confidence in you all, that my joy would be shared by all of you.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Cor.2.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote to you with many tears, not that you should be made sorry, but that you might know the love that I have so abundantly for you.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Cor.2.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>But if any has caused sorrow, he has caused sorrow, not to me, but in part (that I not press too heavily) to you all.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Cor.2.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>Sufficient to such a one is this punishment which was inflicted by the many;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Cor.2.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>so that on the contrary you should rather forgive him and comfort him, lest by any means such a one should be swallowed up with his excessive sorrow.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Cor.2.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>Therefore I beg you to confirm your love toward him.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Cor.2.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>For to this end I also wrote, that I might know the proof of you, whether you are obedient in all things.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Cor.2.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>Now I also forgive whomever you forgive anything. For if indeed I have forgiven anything, I have forgiven that one for your sakes in the presence of Christ,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Cor.2.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>that no advantage may be gained over us by Satan; for we are not ignorant of his schemes.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="2Cor.2.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>Now when I came to Troas for the Good News of Christ, and when a door was opened to me in the Lord,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Cor.2.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>I had no relief for my spirit, because I didn&rsquo;t find Titus, my brother, but taking my leave of them, I went out into Macedonia.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Cor.2.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>Now thanks be to God, who always leads us in triumph in Christ, and reveals through us the sweet aroma of his knowledge in every place.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Cor.2.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>For we are a sweet aroma of Christ to God, in those who are saved, and in those who perish;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Cor.2.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span>to the one a stench from death to death; to the other a sweet aroma from life to life. Who is sufficient for these things?</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Cor.2.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span>For we are not as so many, peddling the word of God. But as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God, we speak in Christ.</span>

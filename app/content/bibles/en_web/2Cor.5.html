<span class="verse 2Cor_5_1" data-osis="2Cor.5.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>For we know that if the earthly house of our tent is dissolved, we have a building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal, in the heavens.</span>
<span class="verse 2Cor_5_2" data-osis="2Cor.5.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>For most certainly in this we groan, longing to be clothed with our habitation which is from heaven;</span>
<span class="verse 2Cor_5_3" data-osis="2Cor.5.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>if so be that being clothed we will not be found naked.</span>
<span class="verse 2Cor_5_4" data-osis="2Cor.5.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>For indeed we who are in this tent do groan, being burdened; not that we desire to be unclothed, but that we desire to be clothed, that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life.</span>
<span class="verse 2Cor_5_5" data-osis="2Cor.5.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>Now he who made us for this very thing is God, who also gave to us the down payment of the Spirit.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse 2Cor_5_6" data-osis="2Cor.5.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>Therefore we are always confident and know that while we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord;</span>
<span class="verse 2Cor_5_7" data-osis="2Cor.5.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>for we walk by faith, not by sight.</span>
<span class="verse 2Cor_5_8" data-osis="2Cor.5.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>We are courageous, I say, and are willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be at home with the Lord.</span>
<span class="verse 2Cor_5_9" data-osis="2Cor.5.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>Therefore also we make it our aim, whether at home or absent, to be well pleasing to him.</span>
<span class="verse 2Cor_5_10" data-osis="2Cor.5.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>For we must all be revealed before the judgment seat of Christ; that each one may receive the things in the body, according to what he has done, whether good or bad.</span>
<span class="verse 2Cor_5_11" data-osis="2Cor.5.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>Knowing therefore the fear of the Lord, we persuade men, but we are revealed to God; and I hope that we are revealed also in your consciences.</span>
<span class="verse 2Cor_5_12" data-osis="2Cor.5.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>For we are not commending ourselves to you again, but speak as giving you occasion of boasting on our behalf, that you may have something to answer those who boast in appearance, and not in heart.</span>
<span class="verse 2Cor_5_13" data-osis="2Cor.5.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>For if we are beside ourselves, it is for God. Or if we are of sober mind, it is for you.</span>
<span class="verse 2Cor_5_14" data-osis="2Cor.5.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>For the love of Christ constrains us; because we judge thus, that one died for all, therefore all died.</span>
<span class="verse 2Cor_5_15" data-osis="2Cor.5.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>He died for all, that those who live should no longer live to themselves, but to him who for their sakes died and rose again.</span>
<span class="verse 2Cor_5_16" data-osis="2Cor.5.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>Therefore we know no one after the flesh from now on. Even though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now we know him so no more.</span>
<span class="verse 2Cor_5_17" data-osis="2Cor.5.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>Therefore if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old things have passed away. Behold,<span class="note">+<dfn>&ldquo;Behold,&rdquo; from &ldquo;ἰδοὺ,&rdquo; means look at, take notice, observe, see, or gaze at. It is often used as an interjection.</dfn></span> all things have become new.</span>
<span class="verse 2Cor_5_18" data-osis="2Cor.5.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>But all things are of God, who reconciled us to himself through Jesus Christ, and gave to us the ministry of reconciliation;</span>
<span class="verse 2Cor_5_19" data-osis="2Cor.5.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>namely, that God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself, not reckoning to them their trespasses, and having committed to us the word of reconciliation.</span>
<span class="verse 2Cor_5_20" data-osis="2Cor.5.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>We are therefore ambassadors on behalf of Christ, as though God were entreating by us: we beg you on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God.</span>
<span class="verse 2Cor_5_21" data-osis="2Cor.5.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>For him who knew no sin he made to be sin on our behalf; so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.</span>

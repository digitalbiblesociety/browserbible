<span class="verse" data-osis="2Kgs.22.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign; and he reigned thirty-one years in Jerusalem: and his mother&rsquo;s name was Jedidah the daughter of Adaiah of Bozkath.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Kgs.22.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>He did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh, and walked in all the way of David his father, and didn&rsquo;t turn aside to the right hand or to the left.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Kgs.22.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>It happened in the eighteenth year of king Josiah, that the king sent Shaphan, the son of Azaliah the son of Meshullam, the scribe, to the house of Yahweh, saying,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Kgs.22.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Go up to Hilkiah the high priest, that he may sum the money which is brought into the house of Yahweh, which the keepers of the threshold have gathered of the people.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Kgs.22.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>Let them deliver it into the hand of the workmen who have the oversight of the house of Yahweh; and let them give it to the workmen who are in the house of Yahweh, to repair the breaches of the house,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Kgs.22.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>to the carpenters, and to the builders, and to the masons, and for buying timber and cut stone to repair the house.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Kgs.22.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>However there was no accounting made with them of the money that was delivered into their hand; for they dealt faithfully.&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="2Kgs.22.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>Hilkiah the high priest said to Shaphan the scribe, &ldquo;I have found the book of the law in the house of Yahweh.&rdquo; Hilkiah delivered the book to Shaphan, and he read it.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Kgs.22.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>Shaphan the scribe came to the king, and brought the king word again, and said, &ldquo;Your servants have emptied out the money that was found in the house, and have delivered it into the hand of the workmen who have the oversight of the house of Yahweh.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Kgs.22.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>Shaphan the scribe told the king, saying, &ldquo;Hilkiah the priest has delivered a book to me.&rdquo; Shaphan read it before the king.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Kgs.22.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>It happened, when the king had heard the words of the book of the law, that he tore his clothes.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Kgs.22.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>The king commanded Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Achbor the son of Micaiah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah the king&rsquo;s servant, saying,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Kgs.22.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Go inquire of Yahweh for me, and for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that is found; for great is the wrath of Yahweh that is kindled against us, because our fathers have not listened to the words of this book, to do according to all that which is written concerning us.&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="2Kgs.22.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>So Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam, and Achbor, and Shaphan, and Asaiah, went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvah, the son of Harhas, keeper of the wardrobe (now she lived in Jerusalem in the second quarter); and they talked with her.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Kgs.22.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>She said to them, &ldquo;Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel: &lsquo;Tell the man who sent you to me,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Kgs.22.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Thus says Yahweh, &lsquo;Behold, I will bring evil on this place, and on its inhabitants, even all the words of the book which the king of Judah has read.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Kgs.22.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span>Because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense to other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the work of their hands, therefore my wrath shall be kindled against this place, and it shall not be quenched.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Kgs.22.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span>But to the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of Yahweh, thus you shall tell him, &ldquo;Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel: &lsquo;Concerning the words which you have heard,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Kgs.22.19"><span class="verse-num">19&nbsp;</span>because your heart was tender, and you humbled yourself before Yahweh, when you heard what I spoke against this place, and against its inhabitants, that they should become a desolation and a curse, and have torn your clothes, and wept before me; I also have heard you,&rsquo; says Yahweh.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Kgs.22.20"><span class="verse-num">20&nbsp;</span>&lsquo;Therefore behold, I will gather you to your fathers, and you shall be gathered to your grave in peace, neither shall your eyes see all the evil which I will bring on this place.&rsquo;&rdquo;&rsquo;&rdquo; They brought back this message to the king.</span>

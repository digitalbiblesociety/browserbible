<span class="verse" data-osis="2Sam.1.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>It happened after the death of Saul, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had stayed two days in Ziklag;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Sam.1.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>it happened on the third day, that behold,<span class="note">+<dfn>&ldquo;Behold,&rdquo; from &ldquo;הִנֵּה&rdquo;, means look at, take notice, observe, see, or gaze at. It is often used as an interjection.</dfn></span> a man came out of the camp from Saul, with his clothes torn, and earth on his head: and so it was, when he came to David, that he fell to the earth, and showed respect.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Sam.1.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>David said to him, &ldquo;Where do you come from?&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Sam.1.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>David said to the young man who told him, &ldquo;How do you know that Saul and Jonathan his son are dead?&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="2Sam.1.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>The young man who told him said, &ldquo;As I happened by chance on Mount Gilboa, behold, Saul was leaning on his spear; and behold, the chariots and the horsemen followed hard after him.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Sam.1.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>When he looked behind him, he saw me, and called to me. I answered, &lsquo;Here I am.&rsquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Sam.1.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>He said to me, &lsquo;Who are you?&rsquo; I answered him, &lsquo;I am an Amalekite.&rsquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Sam.1.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>He said to me, &lsquo;Please stand beside me, and kill me; for anguish has taken hold of me, because my life is yet whole in me.&rsquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Sam.1.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>So I stood beside him, and killed him, because I was sure that he could not live after that he had fallen. I took the crown that was on his head, and the bracelet that was on his arm, and have brought them here to my lord.&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="2Sam.1.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>Then David took hold on his clothes, and tore them; and likewise all the men who were with him.</span>

<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="2Sam.1.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>David said to him, &ldquo;How were you not afraid to stretch out your hand to destroy Yahweh&rsquo;s anointed?&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Sam.1.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>David called one of the young men, and said, &ldquo;Go near, and fall on him.&rdquo; He struck him, so that he died.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Sam.1.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span>David said to him, &ldquo;Your blood be on your head; for your mouth has testified against you, saying, &lsquo;I have slain Yahweh&rsquo;s anointed.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span>

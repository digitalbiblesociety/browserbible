<span class="verse" data-osis="2Sam.5.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>Then came all the tribes of Israel to David to Hebron, and spoke, saying, &ldquo;Behold, we are your bone and your flesh.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Sam.5.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>In times past, when Saul was king over us, it was you who led out and brought in Israel. Yahweh said to you, &lsquo;You shall be shepherd of my people Israel, and you shall be prince over Israel.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Sam.5.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron; and king David made a covenant with them in Hebron before Yahweh; and they anointed David king over Israel.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Sam.5.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>David was thirty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Sam.5.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months; and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty-three years over all Israel and Judah.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Sam.5.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>The king and his men went to Jerusalem against the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land, who spoke to David, saying, &ldquo;Unless you take away the blind and the lame, you shall not come in here&rdquo;; thinking, &ldquo;David can&rsquo;t come in here.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Sam.5.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>Nevertheless David took the stronghold of Zion; the same is the city of David.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Sam.5.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>David said on that day, &ldquo;Whoever strikes the Jebusites, let him get up to the watercourse, and strike the lame and the blind, who are hated by David&rsquo;s soul.&rdquo; Therefore they say, &ldquo;The blind and the lame can&rsquo;t come into the house.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Sam.5.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>David lived in the stronghold, and called it the city of David. David built around from Millo and inward.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Sam.5.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>David grew greater and greater; for Yahweh, the God of Armies, was with him.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Sam.5.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar trees, and carpenters, and masons; and they built David a house.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Sam.5.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>David perceived that Yahweh had established him king over Israel, and that he had exalted his kingdom for his people Israel&rsquo;s sake.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Sam.5.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>David took him more concubines and wives out of Jerusalem, after he had come from Hebron; and there were yet sons and daughters born to David.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Sam.5.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>These are the names of those who were born to him in Jerusalem: Shammua, and Shobab, and Nathan, and Solomon,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Sam.5.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>and Ibhar, and Elishua, and Nepheg, and Japhia,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Sam.5.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span>and Elishama, and Eliada, and Eliphelet.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Sam.5.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span>When the Philistines heard that they had anointed David king over Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek David; and David heard of it, and went down to the stronghold.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Sam.5.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span>Now the Philistines had come and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Sam.5.19"><span class="verse-num">19&nbsp;</span>David inquired of Yahweh, saying, &ldquo;Shall I go up against the Philistines? Will you deliver them into my hand?&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="2Sam.5.20"><span class="verse-num">20&nbsp;</span>David came to Baal Perazim, and David struck them there; and he said, &ldquo;Yahweh has broken my enemies before me, like the breach of waters.&rdquo; Therefore he called the name of that place Baal Perazim.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Sam.5.21"><span class="verse-num">21&nbsp;</span>They left their images there; and David and his men took them away.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Sam.5.22"><span class="verse-num">22&nbsp;</span>The Philistines came up yet again, and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Sam.5.23"><span class="verse-num">23&nbsp;</span>When David inquired of Yahweh, he said, &ldquo;You shall not go up. Circle around behind them, and attack them over against the mulberry trees.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Sam.5.24"><span class="verse-num">24&nbsp;</span>It shall be, when you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the mulberry trees, that then you shall stir yourself up; for then Yahweh has gone out before you to strike the army of the Philistines.&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="2Sam.5.25"><span class="verse-num">25&nbsp;</span>David did so, as Yahweh commanded him, and struck the Philistines from Geba until you come to Gezer.</span>

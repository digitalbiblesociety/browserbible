<span class="verse" data-osis="2Sam.7.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>It happened, when the king lived in his house, and Yahweh had given him rest from all his enemies all around,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Sam.7.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>that the king said to Nathan the prophet, &ldquo;See now, I dwell in a house of cedar, but the ark of God dwells within curtains.&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="2Sam.7.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>Nathan said to the king, &ldquo;Go, do all that is in your heart; for Yahweh is with you.&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="2Sam.7.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>It happened the same night, that the word of Yahweh came to Nathan, saying,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Sam.7.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Go and tell my servant David, &lsquo;Thus says Yahweh, &ldquo;Shall you build me a house for me to dwell in?</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Sam.7.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>For I have not lived in a house since the day that I brought up the children of Israel out of Egypt, even to this day, but have moved around in a tent and in a tabernacle.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Sam.7.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>In all places in which I have walked with all the children of Israel, did I say a word to any of the tribes of Israel, whom I commanded to be shepherd of my people Israel, saying, &lsquo;Why have you not built me a house of cedar?&rsquo;&rdquo;&rsquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Sam.7.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>Now therefore you shall tell my servant David this, &lsquo;Thus says Yahweh of Armies, &ldquo;I took you from the sheep pen, from following the sheep, that you should be prince over my people, over Israel.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Sam.7.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>I have been with you wherever you went, and have cut off all your enemies from before you. I will make you a great name, like the name of the great ones who are in the earth.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Sam.7.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in their own place, and be moved no more; neither shall the children of wickedness afflict them any more, as at the first,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Sam.7.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>and as from the day that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel. I will cause you to rest from all your enemies. Moreover Yahweh tells you that Yahweh will make you a house.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Sam.7.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>When your days are fulfilled, and you shall sleep with your fathers, I will set up your seed after you, who shall proceed out of your bowels, and I will establish his kingdom.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Sam.7.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>He shall build a house for my name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Sam.7.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>I will be his father, and he shall be my son. If he commits iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men, and with the stripes of the children of men;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Sam.7.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>but my loving kindness shall not depart from him, as I took it from Saul, whom I put away before you.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Sam.7.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span>Your house and your kingdom shall be made sure forever before you. Your throne shall be established forever.&rdquo;&rsquo;&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Sam.7.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span>According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so Nathan spoke to David.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="2Sam.7.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span>Then David the king went in, and sat before Yahweh; and he said, &ldquo;Who am I, Lord<span class="note">+<dfn>The word translated &ldquo;Lord&rdquo; is &ldquo;Adonai.&rdquo;</dfn></span> Yahweh, and what is my house, that you have brought me thus far?</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Sam.7.19"><span class="verse-num">19&nbsp;</span>This was yet a small thing in your eyes, Lord Yahweh; but you have spoken also of your servant&rsquo;s house for a great while to come; and this after the way of men, Lord Yahweh!</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Sam.7.20"><span class="verse-num">20&nbsp;</span>What more can David say to you? For you know your servant, Lord Yahweh.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Sam.7.21"><span class="verse-num">21&nbsp;</span>For your word&rsquo;s sake, and according to your own heart, you have worked all this greatness, to make your servant know it.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Sam.7.22"><span class="verse-num">22&nbsp;</span>Therefore you are great, Yahweh God. For there is no one like you, neither is there any God besides you, according to all that we have heard with our ears.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Sam.7.23"><span class="verse-num">23&nbsp;</span>What one nation in the earth is like your people, even like Israel, whom God went to redeem to himself for a people, and to make himself a name, and to do great things for you, and awesome things for your land, before your people, whom you redeem to yourself out of Egypt, from the nations and their gods?</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Sam.7.24"><span class="verse-num">24&nbsp;</span>You established for yourself your people Israel to be a people to you forever; and you, Yahweh, became their God.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Sam.7.25"><span class="verse-num">25&nbsp;</span>Now, Yahweh God, the word that you have spoken concerning your servant, and concerning his house, confirm it forever, and do as you have spoken.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Sam.7.26"><span class="verse-num">26&nbsp;</span>Let your name be magnified forever, saying, &lsquo;Yahweh of Armies is God over Israel; and the house of your servant David shall be established before you.&rsquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Sam.7.27"><span class="verse-num">27&nbsp;</span>For you, Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, have revealed to your servant, saying, &lsquo;I will build you a house.&rsquo; Therefore your servant has found in his heart to pray this prayer to you.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="2Sam.7.28"><span class="verse-num">28&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Now, O Lord Yahweh, you are God, and your words are truth, and you have promised this good thing to your servant.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Sam.7.29"><span class="verse-num">29&nbsp;</span>Now therefore let it please you to bless the house of your servant, that it may continue forever before you; for you, Lord Yahweh, have spoken it. Let the house of your servant be blessed forever with your blessing.&rdquo;</span>

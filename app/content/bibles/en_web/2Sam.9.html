<span class="verse 2Sam_9_5" data-osis="2Sam.9.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>Then king David sent, and fetched him out of the house of Machir the son of Ammiel, from Lo Debar.</span>
<span class="verse 2Sam_9_6" data-osis="2Sam.9.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, came to David, and fell on his face, and showed respect. David said, &ldquo;Mephibosheth.&rdquo;</span>

<p>
<span class="verse 2Sam_9_7" data-osis="2Sam.9.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>David said to him, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid of him; for I will surely show you kindness for Jonathan your father&rsquo;s sake, and will restore to you all the land of Saul your father. You shall eat bread at my table continually.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse 2Sam_9_8" data-osis="2Sam.9.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>He bowed down, and said, &ldquo;What is your servant, that you should look on such a dead dog as I am?&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse 2Sam_9_9" data-osis="2Sam.9.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>Then the king called to Ziba, Saul&rsquo;s servant, and said to him, &ldquo;All that pertained to Saul and to all his house have I given to your master&rsquo;s son.</span>
<span class="verse 2Sam_9_10" data-osis="2Sam.9.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>You shall till the land for him, you, and your sons, and your servants; and you shall bring in the harvest, that your master&rsquo;s son may have bread to eat: but Mephibosheth your master&rsquo;s son shall eat bread always at my table.&rdquo; Now Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants.</span>
<span class="verse 2Sam_9_11" data-osis="2Sam.9.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>Then Ziba said to the king, &ldquo;According to all that my lord the king commands his servant, so your shall servant do.&rdquo; So Mephibosheth ate at the king&rsquo;s table, like one of the king&rsquo;s sons.</span>
<span class="verse 2Sam_9_12" data-osis="2Sam.9.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>Mephibosheth had a young son, whose name was Mica. All that lived in the house of Ziba were servants to Mephibosheth.</span>

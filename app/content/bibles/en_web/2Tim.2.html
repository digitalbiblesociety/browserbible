<span class="verse" data-osis="2Tim.2.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>You therefore, my child, be strengthened in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Tim.2.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>The things which you have heard from me among many witnesses, commit the same to faithful men, who will be able to teach others also.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Tim.2.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>You therefore must endure hardship, as a good soldier of Christ Jesus.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Tim.2.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>No soldier on duty entangles himself in the affairs of life, that he may please him who enrolled him as a soldier.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Tim.2.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>Also, if anyone competes in athletics, he isn&rsquo;t crowned unless he has competed by the rules.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Tim.2.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>The farmers who labor must be the first to get a share of the crops.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Tim.2.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>Consider what I say, and may the Lord give you understanding in all things.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="2Tim.2.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>Remember Jesus Christ, risen from the dead, of the seed of David, according to my Good News,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Tim.2.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>in which I suffer hardship to the point of chains as a criminal. But God&rsquo;s word isn&rsquo;t chained.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Tim.2.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>Therefore I endure all things for the chosen ones&rsquo; sake, that they also may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Tim.2.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>This saying is faithful:</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Tim.2.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>If we endure,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Tim.2.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>If we are faithless,</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="2Tim.2.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>Remind them of these things, charging them in the sight of the Lord, that they don&rsquo;t argue about words, to no profit, to the subverting of those who hear.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="2Tim.2.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>Give diligence to present yourself approved by God, a workman who doesn&rsquo;t need to be ashamed, properly handling the Word of Truth.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Tim.2.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span>But shun empty chatter, for it will go further in ungodliness,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Tim.2.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span>and those words will consume like gangrene, of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Tim.2.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span>men who have erred concerning the truth, saying that the resurrection is already past, and overthrowing the faith of some.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Tim.2.19"><span class="verse-num">19&nbsp;</span>However God&rsquo;s firm foundation stands, having this seal, &ldquo;The Lord knows those who are his,&rdquo;\x + Numbers 16:5\x* and, &ldquo;Let every one who names the name of the Lord<span class="note">+<dfn>TR reads &ldquo;Christ&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;the Lord&rdquo;</dfn></span> depart from unrighteousness.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Tim.2.20"><span class="verse-num">20&nbsp;</span>Now in a large house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of clay. Some are for honor, and some for dishonor.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Tim.2.21"><span class="verse-num">21&nbsp;</span>If anyone therefore purges himself from these, he will be a vessel for honor, sanctified, and suitable for the master&rsquo;s use, prepared for every good work.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="2Tim.2.22"><span class="verse-num">22&nbsp;</span>Flee from youthful lusts; but pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Tim.2.23"><span class="verse-num">23&nbsp;</span>But refuse foolish and ignorant questionings, knowing that they generate strife.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Tim.2.24"><span class="verse-num">24&nbsp;</span>The Lord&rsquo;s servant must not quarrel, but be gentle towards all, able to teach, patient,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Tim.2.25"><span class="verse-num">25&nbsp;</span>in gentleness correcting those who oppose him: perhaps God may give them repentance leading to a full knowledge of the truth,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Tim.2.26"><span class="verse-num">26&nbsp;</span>and they may recover themselves out of the devil&rsquo;s snare, having been taken captive by him to his will.</span>

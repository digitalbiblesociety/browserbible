<span class="verse" data-osis="2Tim.3.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>For men will be lovers of self, lovers of money, boastful, arrogant, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Tim.3.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>without natural affection, unforgiving, slanderers, without self-control, fierce, not lovers of good,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Tim.3.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>traitors, headstrong, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Tim.3.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>holding a form of godliness, but having denied its power. Turn away from these, also.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Tim.3.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>For some of these are people who creep into houses, and take captive gullible women loaded down with sins, led away by various lusts,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Tim.3.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>always learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Tim.3.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>Even as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so do these also oppose the truth; men corrupted in mind, who concerning the faith, are rejected.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Tim.3.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>But they will proceed no further. For their folly will be evident to all men, as theirs also came to be.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Tim.3.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>But you did follow my teaching, conduct, purpose, faith, patience, love, steadfastness,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Tim.3.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>persecutions, and sufferings: those things that happened to me at Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra. I endured those persecutions. The Lord delivered me out of them all.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Tim.3.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>Yes, and all who desire to live godly in Christ Jesus will suffer persecution.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Tim.3.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>But evil men and impostors will grow worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Tim.3.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>But you remain in the things which you have learned and have been assured of, knowing from whom you have learned them.</span>

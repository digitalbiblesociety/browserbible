<span class="verse Acts_14_2" data-osis="Acts.14.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>But the disbelieving<span class="note"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">or, disobedient</span></span>  Jews stirred up and embittered the souls of the Gentiles against the brothers.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_14_3" data-osis="Acts.14.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>Therefore they stayed there a long time, speaking boldly in the Lord, who testified to the word of his grace, granting signs and wonders to be done by their hands.</span>

<span class="verse Acts_14_8" data-osis="Acts.14.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>At Lystra a certain man sat, impotent in his feet, a cripple from his mother&rsquo;s womb, who never had walked.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_14_9" data-osis="Acts.14.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>He was listening to Paul speaking, who, fastening eyes on him, and seeing that he had faith to be made whole,</span>
<span class="verse Acts_14_10" data-osis="Acts.14.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>said with a loud voice, &ldquo;Stand upright on your feet!&rdquo; He leaped up and walked.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_14_11" data-osis="Acts.14.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>When the multitude saw what Paul had done, they lifted up their voice, saying in the language of Lycaonia, &ldquo;The gods have come down to us in the likeness of men!&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Acts_14_12" data-osis="Acts.14.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>They called Barnabas &ldquo;Jupiter,&rdquo; and Paul &ldquo;Mercury,&rdquo; because he was the chief speaker.</span>

<span class="verse Acts_14_14" data-osis="Acts.14.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>But when the apostles, Barnabas and Paul, heard of it, they tore their clothes, and sprang into the multitude, crying out,</span>
<span class="verse Acts_14_15" data-osis="Acts.14.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Men, why are you doing these things? We also are men of like passions with you, and bring you good news, that you should turn from these vain things to the living God, who made the sky and the earth and the sea, and all that is in them;</span>
<span class="verse Acts_14_16" data-osis="Acts.14.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>who in the generations gone by allowed all the nations to walk in their own ways.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_14_17" data-osis="Acts.14.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>Yet he didn&rsquo;t leave himself without witness, in that he did good and gave you<span class="note"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">TR reads &ldquo;us&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;you&rdquo;</span></span>  rains from the sky and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food and gladness.&rdquo;</span>

<p>
<span class="verse Acts_14_20" data-osis="Acts.14.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>But as the disciples stood around him, he rose up, and entered into the city. On the next day he went out with Barnabas to Derbe.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_14_21" data-osis="Acts.14.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>When they had preached the Good News to that city, and had made many disciples, they returned to Lystra, Iconium, and Antioch,</span>
<span class="verse Acts_14_22" data-osis="Acts.14.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>confirming the souls of the disciples, exhorting them to continue in the faith, and that through many afflictions we must enter into the Kingdom of God.</span>

<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.16.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>He came to Derbe and Lystra: and behold, a certain disciple was there, named Timothy, the son of a Jewess who believed; but his father was a Greek.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.16.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>The brothers who were at Lystra and Iconium gave a good testimony about him.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.16.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>Paul wanted to have him go out with him, and he took and circumcised him because of the Jews who were in those parts; for they all knew that his father was a Greek.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.16.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>As they went on their way through the cities, they delivered the decrees to them to keep which had been ordained by the apostles and elders who were at Jerusalem.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.16.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>So the assemblies were strengthened in the faith, and increased in number daily.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.16.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>When they had gone through the region of Phrygia and Galatia, they were forbidden by the Holy Spirit to speak the word in Asia.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.16.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>When they had come opposite Mysia, they tried to go into Bithynia, but the Spirit didn&rsquo;t allow them.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.16.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>Passing by Mysia, they came down to Troas.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.16.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>A vision appeared to Paul in the night. There was a man of Macedonia standing, begging him, and saying, &ldquo;Come over into Macedonia and help us.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.16.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>When he had seen the vision, immediately we sought to go out to Macedonia, concluding that the Lord had called us to preach the Good News to them.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.16.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>Setting sail therefore from Troas, we made a straight course to Samothrace, and the day following to Neapolis;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.16.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>and from there to Philippi, which is a city of Macedonia, the foremost of the district, a Roman colony. We were staying some days in this city.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.16.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>On the Sabbath day we went outside of the city by a riverside, where we supposed there was a place of prayer, and we sat down, and spoke to the women who had come together.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.16.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>A certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple, of the city of Thyatira, one who worshiped God, heard us; whose heart the Lord opened to listen to the things which were spoken by Paul.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.16.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>When she and her household were baptized, she begged us, saying, &ldquo;If you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house, and stay.&rdquo; So she persuaded us.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.16.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span>It happened, as we were going to prayer, that a certain girl having a spirit of divination met us, who brought her masters much gain by fortune telling.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.16.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span>Following Paul and us, she cried out, &ldquo;These men are servants of the Most High God, who proclaim to us a way of salvation!&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.16.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span>She was doing this for many days.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.16.19"><span class="verse-num">19&nbsp;</span>But when her masters saw that the hope of their gain was gone, they seized Paul and Silas, and dragged them into the marketplace before the rulers.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.16.20"><span class="verse-num">20&nbsp;</span>When they had brought them to the magistrates, they said, &ldquo;These men, being Jews, are agitating our city,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.16.21"><span class="verse-num">21&nbsp;</span>and advocate customs which it is not lawful for us to accept or to observe, being Romans.&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.16.22"><span class="verse-num">22&nbsp;</span>The multitude rose up together against them, and the magistrates tore their clothes off of them, and commanded them to be beaten with rods.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.16.23"><span class="verse-num">23&nbsp;</span>When they had laid many stripes on them, they threw them into prison, charging the jailer to keep them safely,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.16.24"><span class="verse-num">24&nbsp;</span>who, having received such a command, threw them into the inner prison, and secured their feet in the stocks.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.16.25"><span class="verse-num">25&nbsp;</span>But about midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the prisoners were listening to them.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.16.26"><span class="verse-num">26&nbsp;</span>Suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken; and immediately all the doors were opened, and everyone&rsquo;s bonds were loosened.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.16.27"><span class="verse-num">27&nbsp;</span>The jailer, being roused out of sleep and seeing the prison doors open, drew his sword and was about to kill himself, supposing that the prisoners had escaped.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.16.28"><span class="verse-num">28&nbsp;</span>But Paul cried with a loud voice, saying, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t harm yourself, for we are all here!&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.16.29"><span class="verse-num">29&nbsp;</span>He called for lights, sprang in, fell down trembling before Paul and Silas,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.16.30"><span class="verse-num">30&nbsp;</span>brought them out, and said, &ldquo;Sirs, what must I do to be saved?&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.16.31"><span class="verse-num">31&nbsp;</span>They said, &ldquo;Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and you will be saved, you and your household.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.16.32"><span class="verse-num">32&nbsp;</span>They spoke the word of the Lord to him, and to all who were in his house.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.16.33"><span class="verse-num">33&nbsp;</span>He took them the same hour of the night, and washed their stripes, and was immediately baptized, he and all his household.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.16.34"><span class="verse-num">34&nbsp;</span>He brought them up into his house, and set food before them, and rejoiced greatly, with all his household, having believed in God.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.16.35"><span class="verse-num">35&nbsp;</span>But when it was day, the magistrates sent the sergeants, saying, &ldquo;Let those men go.&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.16.36"><span class="verse-num">36&nbsp;</span>The jailer reported these words to Paul, saying, &ldquo;The magistrates have sent to let you go; now therefore come out, and go in peace.&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.16.37"><span class="verse-num">37&nbsp;</span>But Paul said to them, &ldquo;They have beaten us publicly, without a trial, men who are Romans, and have cast us into prison! Do they now release us secretly? No, most certainly, but let them come themselves and bring us out!&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.16.38"><span class="verse-num">38&nbsp;</span>The sergeants reported these words to the magistrates, and they were afraid when they heard that they were Romans,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.16.39"><span class="verse-num">39&nbsp;</span>and they came and begged them. When they had brought them out, they asked them to depart from the city.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.16.40"><span class="verse-num">40&nbsp;</span>They went out of the prison, and entered into Lydia&rsquo;s house. When they had seen the brothers, they encouraged them, and departed.</span>

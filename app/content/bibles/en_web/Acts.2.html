<span class="verse Acts_2_2" data-osis="Acts.2.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>Suddenly there came from the sky a sound like the rushing of a mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_2_3" data-osis="Acts.2.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>Tongues like fire appeared and were distributed to them, and one sat on each of them.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_2_4" data-osis="Acts.2.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>They were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and began to speak with other languages, as the Spirit gave them the ability to speak.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_2_5" data-osis="Acts.2.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>Now there were dwelling in Jerusalem Jews, devout men, from every nation under the sky.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_2_6" data-osis="Acts.2.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>When this sound was heard, the multitude came together, and were bewildered, because everyone heard them speaking in his own language.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_2_7" data-osis="Acts.2.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>They were all amazed and marveled, saying to one another, &ldquo;Behold, aren&rsquo;t all these who speak Galileans?</span>
<span class="verse Acts_2_8" data-osis="Acts.2.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>How do we hear, everyone in our own native language?</span>
<span class="verse Acts_2_9" data-osis="Acts.2.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>Parthians, Medes, Elamites, and people from Mesopotamia, Judea, Cappadocia, Pontus, Asia,</span>
<span class="verse Acts_2_10" data-osis="Acts.2.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>Phrygia, Pamphylia, Egypt, the parts of Libya around Cyrene, visitors from Rome, both Jews and proselytes,</span>
<span class="verse Acts_2_11" data-osis="Acts.2.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>Cretans and Arabians: we hear them speaking in our languages the mighty works of God!&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Acts_2_12" data-osis="Acts.2.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>They were all amazed, and were perplexed, saying one to another, &ldquo;What does this mean?&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Acts_2_13" data-osis="Acts.2.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>Others, mocking, said, &ldquo;They are filled with new wine.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Acts_2_14" data-osis="Acts.2.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>But Peter, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice, and spoke out to them, &ldquo;You men of Judea, and all you who dwell at Jerusalem, let this be known to you, and listen to my words.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_2_15" data-osis="Acts.2.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>For these aren&rsquo;t drunken, as you suppose, seeing it is only the third hour of the day<span class="note">+<dfn>about 9:00 AM</dfn></span>.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_2_16" data-osis="Acts.2.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>But this is what has been spoken through the prophet Joel:</span>
<span class="verse Acts_2_17" data-osis="Acts.2.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>&lsquo;It will be in the last days, says God,</span>
<span class="verse Acts_2_18" data-osis="Acts.2.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>Yes, and on my servants and on my handmaidens in those days,</span>
<span class="verse Acts_2_19" data-osis="Acts.2.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>I will show wonders in the sky above,</span>
<span class="verse Acts_2_20" data-osis="Acts.2.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>The sun will be turned into darkness,</span>
<span class="verse Acts_2_21" data-osis="Acts.2.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>It will be, that whoever will call on the name of the Lord will be saved.&rsquo;<span class="cf">+<dfn>Joel 2:28-32</dfn></span></span>

<p>
<span class="verse Acts_2_22" data-osis="Acts.2.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Men of Israel, hear these words! Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved by God to you by mighty works and wonders and signs which God did by him in your midst, even as you yourselves know,</span>
<span class="verse Acts_2_23" data-osis="Acts.2.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>him, being delivered up by the determined counsel and foreknowledge of God, you have taken by the hand of lawless men, crucified and killed;</span>
<span class="verse Acts_2_24" data-osis="Acts.2.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span>whom God raised up, having freed him from the agony of death, because it was not possible that he should be held by it.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_2_25" data-osis="Acts.2.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span>For David says concerning him,</span>
<span class="verse Acts_2_26" data-osis="Acts.2.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span>Therefore my heart was glad, and my tongue rejoiced.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_2_27" data-osis="Acts.2.27"><span class="verse-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span>because you will not leave my soul in Hades<span class="note">+<dfn>or, Hell</dfn></span>,</span>
<span class="verse Acts_2_28" data-osis="Acts.2.28"><span class="verse-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span>You made known to me the ways of life.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Acts_2_29" data-osis="Acts.2.29"><span class="verse-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Brothers, I may tell you freely of the patriarch David, that he both died and was buried, and his tomb is with us to this day.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_2_30" data-osis="Acts.2.30"><span class="verse-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span>Therefore, being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him that of the fruit of his body, according to the flesh, he would raise up the Christ to sit on his throne,</span>
<span class="verse Acts_2_31" data-osis="Acts.2.31"><span class="verse-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span>he foreseeing this spoke about the resurrection of the Christ, that neither was his soul left in Hades<span class="note">+<dfn>or, Hell</dfn></span>, nor did his flesh see decay.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_2_32" data-osis="Acts.2.32"><span class="verse-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span>This Jesus God raised up, to which we all are witnesses.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_2_33" data-osis="Acts.2.33"><span class="verse-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span>Being therefore exalted by the right hand of God, and having received from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, he has poured out this, which you now see and hear.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_2_34" data-osis="Acts.2.34"><span class="verse-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span>For David didn&rsquo;t ascend into the heavens, but he says himself,</span>
<span class="verse Acts_2_35" data-osis="Acts.2.35"><span class="verse-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span>until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet.&rdquo;&rsquo;<span class="cf">+<dfn>Psalm 110:1</dfn></span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Acts_2_36" data-osis="Acts.2.36"><span class="verse-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Let all the house of Israel therefore know certainly that God has made him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom you crucified.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Acts_2_37" data-osis="Acts.2.37"><span class="verse-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span>Now when they heard this, they were cut to the heart, and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, &ldquo;Brothers, what shall we do?&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Acts_2_38" data-osis="Acts.2.38"><span class="verse-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span>Peter said to them, &ldquo;Repent, and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_2_39" data-osis="Acts.2.39"><span class="verse-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span>For the promise is to you, and to your children, and to all who are far off, even as many as the Lord our God will call to himself.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Acts_2_40" data-osis="Acts.2.40"><span class="verse-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span>With many other words he testified, and exhorted them, saying, &ldquo;Save yourselves from this crooked generation!&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Acts_2_41" data-osis="Acts.2.41"><span class="verse-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span>Then those who gladly received his word were baptized. There were added that day about three thousand souls.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_2_42" data-osis="Acts.2.42"><span class="verse-num v-42">42&nbsp;</span>They continued steadfastly in the apostles&rsquo; teaching and fellowship, in the breaking of bread, and prayer.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_2_43" data-osis="Acts.2.43"><span class="verse-num v-43">43&nbsp;</span>Fear came on every soul, and many wonders and signs were done through the apostles.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_2_44" data-osis="Acts.2.44"><span class="verse-num v-44">44&nbsp;</span>All who believed were together, and had all things in common.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_2_45" data-osis="Acts.2.45"><span class="verse-num v-45">45&nbsp;</span>They sold their possessions and goods, and distributed them to all, according as anyone had need.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_2_46" data-osis="Acts.2.46"><span class="verse-num v-46">46&nbsp;</span>Day by day, continuing steadfastly with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread at home, they took their food with gladness and singleness of heart,</span>
<span class="verse Acts_2_47" data-osis="Acts.2.47"><span class="verse-num v-47">47&nbsp;</span>praising God, and having favor with all the people. The Lord added to the assembly day by day those who were being saved.</span>

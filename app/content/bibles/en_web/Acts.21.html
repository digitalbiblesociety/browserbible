<span class="verse Acts_21_4" data-osis="Acts.21.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>Having found disciples, we stayed there seven days. These said to Paul through the Spirit, that he should not go up to Jerusalem.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_21_5" data-osis="Acts.21.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>When it happened that we had accomplished the days, we departed and went on our journey.

<span class="verse Acts_21_6" data-osis="Acts.21.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>After saying goodbye to each other, we went on board the ship, and they returned home again.</span>

<span class="verse Acts_21_7" data-osis="Acts.21.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>When we had finished the voyage from Tyre, we arrived at Ptolemais. We greeted the brothers, and stayed with them one day.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_21_8" data-osis="Acts.21.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>On the next day, we, who were Paul&rsquo;s companions, departed, and came to Caesarea.<br>We entered into the house of Philip the evangelist, who was one of the seven, and stayed with him.</span>

<p>
<span class="verse Acts_21_12" data-osis="Acts.21.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>When we heard these things, both we and they of that place begged him not to go up to Jerusalem.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_21_13" data-osis="Acts.21.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>Then Paul answered, &ldquo;What are you doing, weeping and breaking my heart? For I am ready not only to be bound, but also to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.&rdquo;</span>

<p>
<span class="verse Acts_21_15" data-osis="Acts.21.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>After these days we took up our baggage and went up to Jerusalem.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_21_16" data-osis="Acts.21.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>Some of the disciples from Caesarea also went with us, bringing one Mnason of Cyprus, an early disciple, with whom we would stay.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Acts_21_17" data-osis="Acts.21.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>When we had come to Jerusalem, the brothers received us gladly.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_21_18" data-osis="Acts.21.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>The day following, Paul went in with us to James; and all the elders were present.</span>

<span class="verse Acts_21_20" data-osis="Acts.21.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>They, when they heard it, glorified God. They said to him, &ldquo;You see, brother, how many thousands there are among the Jews of those who have believed, and they are all zealous for the law.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_21_21" data-osis="Acts.21.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>They have been informed about you, that you teach all the Jews who are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, telling them not to circumcise their children neither to walk after the customs.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_21_22" data-osis="Acts.21.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>What then? The assembly must certainly meet, for they will hear that you have come.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_21_23" data-osis="Acts.21.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>Therefore do what we tell you. We have four men who have taken a vow.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_21_24" data-osis="Acts.21.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span>Take them, and purify yourself with them, and pay their expenses for them, that they may shave their heads.

<span class="verse Acts_21_25" data-osis="Acts.21.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span>But concerning the Gentiles who believe, we have written our decision that they should observe no such thing, except that they should keep themselves from food offered to idols, from blood, from strangled things, and from sexual immorality.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse Acts_21_26" data-osis="Acts.21.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span>Then Paul took the men, and the next day, purified himself and went with them into the temple, declaring the fulfillment of the days of purification, until the offering was offered for every one of them.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_21_27" data-osis="Acts.21.27"><span class="verse-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span>When the seven days were almost completed, the Jews from Asia, when they saw him in the temple, stirred up all the multitude and laid hands on him,</span>
<span class="verse Acts_21_28" data-osis="Acts.21.28"><span class="verse-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span>crying out, &ldquo;Men of Israel, help! This is the man who teaches all men everywhere against the people, and the law, and this place. Moreover, he also brought Greeks into the temple, and has defiled this holy place!&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Acts_21_29" data-osis="Acts.21.29"><span class="verse-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span>For they had seen Trophimus, the Ephesian, with him in the city, and they supposed that Paul had brought him into the temple.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Acts_21_30" data-osis="Acts.21.30"><span class="verse-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span>All the city was moved, and the people ran together. They seized Paul and dragged him out of the temple. Immediately the doors were shut.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_21_31" data-osis="Acts.21.31"><span class="verse-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span>As they were trying to kill him, news came up to the commanding officer of the regiment that all Jerusalem was in an uproar.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_21_32" data-osis="Acts.21.32"><span class="verse-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span>Immediately he took soldiers and centurions, and ran down to them. They, when they saw the chief captain and the soldiers, stopped beating Paul.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_21_33" data-osis="Acts.21.33"><span class="verse-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span>Then the commanding officer came near, arrested him, commanded him to be bound with two chains, and inquired who he was and what he had done.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_21_34" data-osis="Acts.21.34"><span class="verse-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span>Some shouted one thing, and some another, among the crowd. When he couldn&rsquo;t find out the truth because of the noise, he commanded him to be brought into the barracks.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Acts_21_35" data-osis="Acts.21.35"><span class="verse-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span>When he came to the stairs, it happened that he was carried by the soldiers because of the violence of the crowd;</span>
<span class="verse Acts_21_36" data-osis="Acts.21.36"><span class="verse-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span>for the multitude of the people followed after, crying out, &ldquo;Away with him!&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Acts_21_37" data-osis="Acts.21.37"><span class="verse-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span>As Paul was about to be brought into the barracks, he asked the commanding officer, &ldquo;May I speak to you?&rdquo;<br>He said, “Do you know Greek?</span>
<span class="verse Acts_21_38" data-osis="Acts.21.38"><span class="verse-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span>Aren&rsquo;t you then the Egyptian, who before these days stirred up to sedition and led out into the wilderness the four thousand men of the Assassins?&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Acts_21_39" data-osis="Acts.21.39"><span class="verse-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span>But Paul said, &ldquo;I am a Jew, from Tarsus in Cilicia, a citizen of no insignificant city. I beg you, allow me to speak to the people.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Acts_21_40" data-osis="Acts.21.40"><span class="verse-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span>When he had given him permission, Paul, standing on the stairs, beckoned with his hand to the people. When there was a great silence, he spoke to them in the Hebrew language, saying,</span>

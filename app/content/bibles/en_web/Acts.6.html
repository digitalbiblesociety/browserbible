<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.6.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>Now in those days, when the number of the disciples was multiplying, a complaint arose from the Hellenists<span class="note">+<dfn>The Hellenists used Greek language and culture, even though they were also of Hebrew descent.</dfn></span> against the Hebrews, because their widows were neglected in the daily service.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.6.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>The twelve summoned the multitude of the disciples and said, &ldquo;It is not appropriate for us to forsake the word of God and serve tables.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.6.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>Therefore select from among you, brothers, seven men of good report, full of the Holy Spirit and of wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.6.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>But we will continue steadfastly in prayer and in the ministry of the word.&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.6.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>These words pleased the whole multitude. They chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit, Philip, Prochorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas, and Nicolaus, a proselyte of Antioch;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.6.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>whom they set before the apostles. When they had prayed, they laid their hands on them.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.6.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>The word of God increased and the number of the disciples multiplied in Jerusalem exceedingly. A great company of the priests were obedient to the faith.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.6.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>Stephen, full of faith and power, performed great wonders and signs among the people.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.6.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>But some of those who were of the synagogue called &ldquo;The Libertines,&rdquo; and of the Cyrenians, of the Alexandrians, and of those of Cilicia and Asia arose, disputing with Stephen.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.6.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>They weren&rsquo;t able to withstand the wisdom and the Spirit by which he spoke.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.6.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>Then they secretly induced men to say, &ldquo;We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses and God.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.6.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>They stirred up the people, the elders, and the scribes, and came against him and seized him, and brought him in to the council,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.6.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>and set up false witnesses who said, &ldquo;This man never stops speaking blasphemous words against this holy place and the law.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.6.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>For we have heard him say that this Jesus of Nazareth will destroy this place, and will change the customs which Moses delivered to us.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.6.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>All who sat in the council, fastening their eyes on him, saw his face like it was the face of an angel.</span>

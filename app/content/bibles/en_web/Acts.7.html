</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Acts_7_2" data-osis="Acts.7.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>He said, &ldquo;Brothers and fathers, listen. The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham, when he was in Mesopotamia, before he lived in Haran,</span>
<span class="verse Acts_7_3" data-osis="Acts.7.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>and said to him, &lsquo;Get out of your land, and from your relatives, and come into a land which I will show you.&rsquo;<span class="cf">+<dfn>Genesis 12:1</dfn></span></span>
<span class="verse Acts_7_4" data-osis="Acts.7.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>Then he came out of the land of the Chaldaeans, and lived in Haran. From there, when his father was dead, God moved him into this land, where you are now living.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_7_5" data-osis="Acts.7.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>He gave him no inheritance in it, no, not so much as to set his foot on. He promised that he would give it to him for a possession, and to his seed after him, when he still had no child.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_7_6" data-osis="Acts.7.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>God spoke in this way: that his seed would live as aliens in a strange land, and that they would be enslaved and mistreated for four hundred years.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_7_7" data-osis="Acts.7.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>&lsquo;I will judge the nation to which they will be in bondage,&rsquo; said God, &lsquo;and after that will they come out, and serve me in this place.&rsquo;<span class="cf">+<dfn>Genesis 15:13-14</dfn></span></span>
<span class="verse Acts_7_8" data-osis="Acts.7.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>He gave him the covenant of circumcision. So Abraham became the father of Isaac, and circumcised him the eighth day. Isaac became the father of Jacob, and Jacob became the father of the twelve patriarchs.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Acts_7_9" data-osis="Acts.7.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;The patriarchs, moved with jealousy against Joseph, sold him into Egypt. God was with him,</span>
<span class="verse Acts_7_10" data-osis="Acts.7.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>and delivered him out of all his afflictions, and gave him favor and wisdom before Pharaoh, king of Egypt. He made him governor over Egypt and all his house.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_7_11" data-osis="Acts.7.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>Now a famine came over all the land of Egypt and Canaan, and great affliction. Our fathers found no food.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_7_12" data-osis="Acts.7.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>But when Jacob heard that there was grain in Egypt, he sent out our fathers the first time.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_7_13" data-osis="Acts.7.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>On the second time Joseph was made known to his brothers, and Joseph&rsquo;s race was revealed to Pharaoh.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_7_14" data-osis="Acts.7.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>Joseph sent, and summoned Jacob, his father, and all his relatives, seventy-five souls.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_7_15" data-osis="Acts.7.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>Jacob went down into Egypt, and he died, himself and our fathers,</span>
<span class="verse Acts_7_16" data-osis="Acts.7.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>and they were brought back to Shechem, and laid in the tomb that Abraham bought for a price in silver from the children of Hamor of Shechem.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Acts_7_17" data-osis="Acts.7.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;But as the time of the promise came close which God had sworn to Abraham, the people grew and multiplied in Egypt,</span>
<span class="verse Acts_7_18" data-osis="Acts.7.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>until there arose a different king, who didn&rsquo;t know Joseph.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_7_19" data-osis="Acts.7.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>The same took advantage of our race, and mistreated our fathers, and forced them to throw out their babies, so that they wouldn&rsquo;t stay alive.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_7_20" data-osis="Acts.7.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>At that time Moses was born, and was exceedingly handsome. He was nourished three months in his father&rsquo;s house.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_7_21" data-osis="Acts.7.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>When he was thrown out, Pharaoh&rsquo;s daughter took him up, and reared him as her own son.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_7_22" data-osis="Acts.7.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>Moses was instructed in all the wisdom of the Egyptians. He was mighty in his words and works.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_7_23" data-osis="Acts.7.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>But when he was forty years old, it came into his heart to visit his brothers</span>
<span class="verse Acts_7_24" data-osis="Acts.7.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span>Seeing one of them suffer wrong, he defended him, and avenged him who was oppressed, striking the Egyptian.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_7_25" data-osis="Acts.7.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span>He supposed that his brothers understood that God, by his hand, was giving them deliverance; but they didn&rsquo;t understand.</span>

<span class="verse Acts_7_26" data-osis="Acts.7.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;The day following, he appeared to them as they fought, and urged them to be at peace again, saying, &lsquo;Sirs, you are brothers. Why do you wrong one another?&rsquo;</span>
<span class="verse Acts_7_27" data-osis="Acts.7.27"><span class="verse-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span>But he who did his neighbor wrong pushed him away, saying, &lsquo;Who made you a ruler and a judge over us?</span>

<span class="verse Acts_7_31" data-osis="Acts.7.31"><span class="verse-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span>When Moses saw it, he wondered at the sight. As he came close to see, a voice of the Lord came to him,</span>
<span class="verse Acts_7_32" data-osis="Acts.7.32"><span class="verse-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span>&lsquo;I am the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.&rsquo;<span class="cf">+<dfn>Exodus 3:6</dfn></span> Moses trembled, and dared not look.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_7_33" data-osis="Acts.7.33"><span class="verse-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span>The Lord said to him, &lsquo;Take your sandals off of your feet, for the place where you stand is holy ground.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_7_34" data-osis="Acts.7.34"><span class="verse-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span>I have surely seen the affliction of my people that is in Egypt, and have heard their groaning.

<span class="verse Acts_7_52" data-osis="Acts.7.52"><span class="verse-num v-52">52&nbsp;</span>Which of the prophets didn&rsquo;t your fathers persecute? They killed those who foretold the coming of the Righteous One, of whom you have now become betrayers and murderers.</span>

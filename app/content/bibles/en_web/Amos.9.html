<span class="verse" data-osis="Amos.9.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>I saw the Lord standing beside the altar, and he said, &ldquo;Strike the tops of the pillars, that the thresholds may shake; and break them in pieces on the head of all of them; and I will kill the last of them with the sword: there shall not one of them flee away, and there shall not one of them escape.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Amos.9.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>Though they dig into Sheol<span class="note">+<dfn>Sheol is the place of the dead.</dfn></span>, there my hand will take them; and though they climb up to heaven, there I will bring them down.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Amos.9.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>Though they hide themselves in the top of Carmel, I will search and take them out there; and though they be hidden from my sight in the bottom of the sea, there I will command the serpent, and it will bite them.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Amos.9.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>Though they go into captivity before their enemies, there I will command the sword, and it will kill them. I will set my eyes on them for evil, and not for good.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Amos.9.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>For the Lord, Yahweh of Armies, is he who touches the land and it melts, and all who dwell in it will mourn; and it will rise up wholly like the River, and will sink again, like the River of Egypt.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Amos.9.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>It is he who builds his rooms in the heavens, and has founded his vault on the earth; he who calls for the waters of the sea, and pours them out on the surface of the earth; Yahweh is his name.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Amos.9.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>Are you not like the children of the Ethiopians to me, children of Israel?&rdquo; says Yahweh. &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t I brought up Israel out of the land of Egypt, and the Philistines from Caphtor, and the Syrians from Kir?</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Amos.9.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>Behold, the eyes of the Lord Yahweh are on the sinful kingdom, and I will destroy it from off the surface of the earth; except that I will not utterly destroy the house of Jacob,&rdquo; says Yahweh.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Amos.9.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;For, behold, I will command, and I will sift the house of Israel among all the nations, as grain is sifted in a sieve, yet not the least kernel will fall on the earth.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Amos.9.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>All the sinners of my people will die by the sword, who say, &lsquo;Evil won&rsquo;t overtake nor meet us.&rsquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Amos.9.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>In that day I will raise up the tent of David who is fallen, and close up its breaches, and I will raise up its ruins, and I will build it as in the days of old;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Amos.9.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>that they may possess the remnant of Edom, and all the nations who are called by my name,&rdquo; says Yahweh who does this.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Amos.9.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Behold, the days come,&rdquo; says Yahweh,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Amos.9.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>I will bring my people Israel back from captivity,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Amos.9.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>I will plant them on their land,</span>

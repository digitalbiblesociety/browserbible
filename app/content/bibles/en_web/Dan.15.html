<span class="verse" data-osis="Dan.15.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>Will wood be taken of it to make anything? Will men take a pin of it to hang any vessel on it?</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Dan.15.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>Behold, it is cast into the fire for fuel; the fire has devoured both its ends, and its midst is burned: is it profitable for any work?</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Dan.15.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>Behold, when it was whole, it was meet for no work: how much less, when the fire has devoured it, and it is burned, shall it yet be meet for any work!</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Dan.15.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh: As the vine tree among the trees of the forest, which I have given to the fire for fuel, so will I give the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</span>

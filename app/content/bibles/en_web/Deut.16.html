<span class="verse" data-osis="Deut.16.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>You shall eat no leavened bread with it.

<span class="verse" data-osis="Deut.16.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>You shall roast and eat it in the place which Yahweh your God chooses. In the morning you shall return to your tents.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Deut.16.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>Six days you shall eat unleavened bread. On the seventh day shall be a solemn assembly to Yahweh your God. You shall do no work.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Deut.16.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>You shall count for yourselves seven weeks. From the time you begin to put the sickle to the standing grain you shall begin to number seven weeks.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Deut.16.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>You shall rejoice before Yahweh your God: you, your son, your daughter, your male servant, your female servant, the Levite who is within your gates, the foreigner, the fatherless, and the widow, who are in your midst, in the place which Yahweh your God shall choose to cause his name to dwell there.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Deut.16.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>You shall remember that you were a slave in Egypt. You shall observe and do these statutes.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Deut.16.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>You shall keep a feast to Yahweh your God seven days in the place which Yahweh chooses; because Yahweh your God will bless you in all your increase, and in all the work of your hands, and you shall be altogether joyful.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Deut.16.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span>Three times in a year all of your shall males appear before Yahweh your God in the place which he chooses: in the feast of unleavened bread, in the feast of weeks, and in the feast of tents.

<span class="verse" data-osis="Deut.16.19"><span class="verse-num">19&nbsp;</span>You shall not pervert justice. You shall not show partiality. You shall not take a bribe, for a bribe blinds the eyes of the wise, and perverts the words of the righteous.</span>

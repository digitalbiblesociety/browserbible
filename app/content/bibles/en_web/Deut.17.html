<span class="verse Deut_17_2" data-osis="Deut.17.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>If there is found in your midst, within any of your gates which Yahweh your God gives you, a man or woman who does that which is evil in the sight of Yahweh your God, in transgressing his covenant,</span>
<span class="verse Deut_17_3" data-osis="Deut.17.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>and has gone and served other gods, and worshiped them, or the sun, or the moon, or any of the stars of the sky, which I have not commanded;</span>
<span class="verse Deut_17_4" data-osis="Deut.17.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>and you are told, and you have heard of it, then you shall inquire diligently. Behold, if it is true, and the thing certain, that such abomination is done in Israel,</span>
<span class="verse Deut_17_5" data-osis="Deut.17.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>then you shall bring out that man or that woman, who has done this evil thing, to your gates, even that same man or woman; and you shall stone them to death with stones.</span>
<span class="verse Deut_17_6" data-osis="Deut.17.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>At the mouth of two witnesses, or three witnesses, he who is to die shall be put to death. At the mouth of one witness he shall not be put to death.</span>
<span class="verse Deut_17_7" data-osis="Deut.17.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>The hand of the witnesses shall be first on him to put him to death, and afterward the hand of all the people. So you shall remove the evil from your midst.</span>
<span class="verse Deut_17_8" data-osis="Deut.17.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>If there arises a matter too hard for you in judgment, between blood and blood, between plea and plea, and between stroke and stroke, being matters of controversy within your gates; then you shall arise, and go up to the place which Yahweh your God chooses.</span>
<span class="verse Deut_17_9" data-osis="Deut.17.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>You shall come to the priests who are Levites, and to the judge who shall be in those days. You shall inquire, and they shall give you the verdict.</span>

<span class="verse Deut_17_11" data-osis="Deut.17.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>according to the decisions of the law which they shall teach you, and according to the judgment which they shall tell you, you shall do.

<span class="verse Deut_17_12" data-osis="Deut.17.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>The man who does presumptuously, in not listening to the priest who stands to minister there before Yahweh your God, or to the judge, even that man shall die. You shall put away the evil from Israel.</span>
<span class="verse Deut_17_13" data-osis="Deut.17.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>All the people shall hear, and fear, and do no more presumptuously.</span>

<span class="verse Deut_17_15" data-osis="Deut.17.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>you shall surely set him king over yourselves, whom Yahweh your God chooses.

<span class="verse Deut_17_16" data-osis="Deut.17.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>Only he shall not multiply horses to himself, nor cause the people to return to Egypt, to the end that he may multiply horses; because Yahweh has said to you, &ldquo;You shall not go back that way again.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Deut_17_17" data-osis="Deut.17.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>He shall not multiply wives to himself, that his heart not turn away. He shall not greatly multiply to himself silver and gold.</span>

<span class="verse Deut_17_18" data-osis="Deut.17.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>It shall be, when he sits on the throne of his kingdom, that he shall write himself a copy of this law in a book, out of that which is before the priests the Levites.</span>
<span class="verse Deut_17_19" data-osis="Deut.17.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>It shall be with him, and he shall read from it all the days of his life; that he may learn to fear Yahweh his God, to keep all the words of this law and these statutes, to do them;</span>
<span class="verse Deut_17_20" data-osis="Deut.17.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>that his heart not be lifted up above his brothers, and that he not turn aside from the commandment, to the right hand, or to the left; to the end that he may prolong his days in his kingdom, he and his children, in the midst of Israel.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Deut.23.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>because they didn&rsquo;t meet you with bread and with water on the way, when you came out of Egypt, and because they hired against you Balaam the son of Beor from Pethor of Mesopotamia, to curse you.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Deut.23.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>Nevertheless Yahweh your God wouldn&rsquo;t listen to Balaam; but Yahweh your God turned the curse into a blessing to you, because Yahweh your God loved you.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Deut.23.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>for Yahweh your God walks in the midst of your camp, to deliver you, and to give up your enemies before you.

<span class="verse" data-osis="Deut.23.19"><span class="verse-num">19&nbsp;</span>You shall not lend on interest to your brother; interest of money, interest of food, interest of anything that is lent on interest.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Deut.23.20"><span class="verse-num">20&nbsp;</span>You may lend on interest to a foreigner; but to your brother you shall not lend on interest, that Yahweh your God may bless you in all that you put your hand to, in the land where you go in to possess it.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Deut.23.21"><span class="verse-num">21&nbsp;</span>When you vow a vow to Yahweh your God, you shall not be slack to pay it; for Yahweh your God will surely require it of you; and it would be sin in you.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Deut.23.22"><span class="verse-num">22&nbsp;</span>But if you refrain from making a vow, it shall be no sin in you.</span>

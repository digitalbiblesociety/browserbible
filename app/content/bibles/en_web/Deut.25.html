<span class="verse" data-osis="Deut.25.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>He may sentence him to no more than forty stripes. He shall not give more; lest, if he should give more, and beat him more than that many stripes, then your brother will be degraded in your sight.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Deut.25.19"><span class="verse-num">19&nbsp;</span>Therefore it shall be, when Yahweh your God has given you rest from all your enemies all around, in the land which Yahweh your God gives you for an inheritance to possess it, that you shall blot out the memory of Amalek from under the sky. You shall not forget.</span>

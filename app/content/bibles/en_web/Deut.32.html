<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Deut.32.44"><span class="verse-num">44&nbsp;</span>Moses came and spoke all the words of this song in the ears of the people, he and Joshua the son of Nun.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Deut.32.45"><span class="verse-num">45&nbsp;</span>Moses finished reciting all these words to all Israel.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Deut.32.46"><span class="verse-num">46&nbsp;</span>He said to them, &ldquo;Set your heart to all the words which I testify to you this day, which you shall command your children to observe to do, all the words of this law.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Deut.32.47"><span class="verse-num">47&nbsp;</span>For it is no vain thing for you; because it is your life, and through this thing you shall prolong your days in the land, where you go over the Jordan to possess it.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Deut.32.50"><span class="verse-num">50&nbsp;</span>Die on the mountain where you go up, and be gathered to your people, as Aaron your brother died on Mount Hor, and was gathered to his people;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Deut.32.51"><span class="verse-num">51&nbsp;</span>because you trespassed against me in the midst of the children of Israel at the waters of Meribah of Kadesh, in the wilderness of Zin; because you didn&rsquo;t uphold my holiness in the midst of the children of Israel.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Deut.32.52"><span class="verse-num">52&nbsp;</span>For you shall see the land from a distance; but you shall not go there into the land which I give the children of Israel.&rdquo;</span>

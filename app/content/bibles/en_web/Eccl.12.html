<span class="verse Eccl_12_1" data-osis="Eccl.12.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>Remember also your Creator in the days of your youth,<br /> before the evil days come, and the years draw near,<br /> when you will say, &ldquo;I have no pleasure in them&rdquo;;<br /></span>
<span class="verse Eccl_12_2" data-osis="Eccl.12.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>Before the sun, the light, the moon, and the stars are darkened,<br /> and the clouds return after the rain;<br /></span>
<span class="verse Eccl_12_3" data-osis="Eccl.12.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>in the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble,<br /> and the strong men shall bow themselves,<br /> and the grinders cease because they are few,<br /> and those who look out of the windows are darkened,<br /></span>
<span class="verse Eccl_12_4" data-osis="Eccl.12.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>and the doors shall be shut in the street;<br /> when the sound of the grinding is low,<br /> and one shall rise up at the voice of a bird,<br /> and all the daughters of music shall be brought low;<br /></span>
<span class="verse Eccl_12_5" data-osis="Eccl.12.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>yes, they shall be afraid of heights,<br /> and terrors will be on the way;<br /> and the almond tree shall blossom,<br /> and the grasshopper shall be a burden,<br /> and desire shall fail;<br /> because man goes to his everlasting home,<br /> and the mourners go about the streets:<br /></span>
<span class="verse Eccl_12_6" data-osis="Eccl.12.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>before the silver cord is severed,<br /> or the golden bowl is broken,<br /> or the pitcher is broken at the spring,<br /> or the wheel broken at the cistern,<br /></span>
<span class="verse Eccl_12_7" data-osis="Eccl.12.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>and the dust returns to the earth as it was,<br /> and the spirit returns to God who gave it.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Eccl_12_8" data-osis="Eccl.12.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Vanity of vanities,&rdquo; says the Preacher.<br /> &ldquo;All is vanity!&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Eccl_12_9" data-osis="Eccl.12.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>Further, because the Preacher was wise, he still taught the people knowledge. Yes, he pondered, sought out, and set in order many proverbs.</span>
<span class="verse Eccl_12_10" data-osis="Eccl.12.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>The Preacher sought to find out acceptable words, and that which was written blamelessly, words of truth.</span>
<span class="verse Eccl_12_11" data-osis="Eccl.12.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>The words of the wise are like goads; and like nails well fastened are words from the masters of assemblies, which are given from one shepherd.</span>
<span class="verse Eccl_12_12" data-osis="Eccl.12.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>Furthermore, my son, be admonished: of making many books there is no end; and much study is a weariness of the flesh.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Eccl_12_13" data-osis="Eccl.12.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>This is the end of the matter. All has been heard. Fear God, and keep his commandments; for this is the whole duty of man.</span>
<span class="verse Eccl_12_14" data-osis="Eccl.12.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>For God will bring every work into judgment, with every hidden thing, whether it is good, or whether it is evil.</span>

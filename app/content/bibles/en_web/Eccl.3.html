<span class="verse Eccl_3_2" data-osis="Eccl.3.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>a time to be born,</span>
<span class="verse Eccl_3_3" data-osis="Eccl.3.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>a time to kill,</span>

<span class="verse Eccl_3_5" data-osis="Eccl.3.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>a time to cast away stones,</span>
<span class="verse Eccl_3_6" data-osis="Eccl.3.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>a time to seek,</span>

<span class="verse Eccl_3_9" data-osis="Eccl.3.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>What profit has he who works in that in which he labors?</span>
<span class="verse Eccl_3_10" data-osis="Eccl.3.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>I have seen the burden which God has given to the sons of men to be afflicted with.</span>
<span class="verse Eccl_3_11" data-osis="Eccl.3.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>He has made everything beautiful in its time. He has also set eternity in their hearts, yet so that man can&rsquo;t find out the work that God has done from the beginning even to the end.</span>
<span class="verse Eccl_3_12" data-osis="Eccl.3.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>I know that there is nothing better for them than to rejoice, and to do good as long as they live.</span>
<span class="verse Eccl_3_13" data-osis="Eccl.3.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>Also that every man should eat and drink, and enjoy good in all his labor, is the gift of God.</span>
<span class="verse Eccl_3_14" data-osis="Eccl.3.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>I know that whatever God does, it shall be forever. Nothing can be added to it, nor anything taken from it; and God has done it, that men should fear before him.</span>
<span class="verse Eccl_3_15" data-osis="Eccl.3.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>That which is has been long ago, and that which is to be has been long ago: and God seeks again that which is passed away.</span>

<span class="verse Eccl_3_16" data-osis="Eccl.3.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>Moreover I saw under the sun, in the place of justice, that wickedness was there; and in the place of righteousness, that wickedness was there.</span>
<span class="verse Eccl_3_17" data-osis="Eccl.3.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>I said in my heart, &ldquo;God will judge the righteous and the wicked; for there is a time there for every purpose and for every work.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Eccl_3_18" data-osis="Eccl.3.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>I said in my heart, &ldquo;As for the sons of men, God tests them, so that they may see that they themselves are like animals.</span>
<span class="verse Eccl_3_19" data-osis="Eccl.3.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>For that which happens to the sons of men happens to animals. Even one thing happens to them. As the one dies, so the other dies. Yes, they have all one breath; and man has no advantage over the animals: for all is vanity.</span>
<span class="verse Eccl_3_20" data-osis="Eccl.3.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>All go to one place. All are from the dust, and all turn to dust again.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Eccl_3_22" data-osis="Eccl.3.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>Therefore I saw that there is nothing better, than that a man should rejoice in his works; for that is his portion: for who can bring him to see what will be after him?</span>

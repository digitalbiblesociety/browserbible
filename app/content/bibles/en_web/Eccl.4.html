<p>
<span class="verse Eccl_4_1" data-osis="Eccl.4.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>Then I returned and saw all the oppressions that are done under the sun: and behold, the tears of those who were oppressed, and they had no comforter; and on the side of their oppressors there was power; but they had no comforter.</span>
<span class="verse Eccl_4_2" data-osis="Eccl.4.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>Therefore I praised the dead who have been long dead more than the living who are yet alive.</span>
<span class="verse Eccl_4_3" data-osis="Eccl.4.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>Yes, better than them both is him who has not yet been, who has not seen the evil work that is done under the sun.</span>
<span class="verse Eccl_4_4" data-osis="Eccl.4.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>Then I saw all the labor and achievement that is the envy of a man&rsquo;s neighbor. This also is vanity and a striving after wind.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Eccl_4_5" data-osis="Eccl.4.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>The fool folds his hands together and ruins himself.</span>
<span class="verse Eccl_4_6" data-osis="Eccl.4.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>Better is a handful, with quietness, than two handfuls with labor and chasing after wind.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Eccl_4_7" data-osis="Eccl.4.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>Then I returned and saw vanity under the sun.</span>
<span class="verse Eccl_4_8" data-osis="Eccl.4.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>There is one who is alone, and he has neither son nor brother. There is no end to all of his labor, neither are his eyes satisfied with wealth. &ldquo;For whom then, do I labor, and deprive my soul of enjoyment?&rdquo; This also is vanity. Yes, it is a miserable business.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Eccl_4_9" data-osis="Eccl.4.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their labor.</span>
<span class="verse Eccl_4_10" data-osis="Eccl.4.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow; but woe to him who is alone when he falls, and doesn&rsquo;t have another to lift him up.</span>
<span class="verse Eccl_4_11" data-osis="Eccl.4.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>Again, if two lie together, then they have warmth; but how can one keep warm alone?</span>
<span class="verse Eccl_4_12" data-osis="Eccl.4.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>If a man prevails against one who is alone, two shall withstand him; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Eccl_4_13" data-osis="Eccl.4.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>Better is a poor and wise youth than an old and foolish king who doesn&rsquo;t know how to receive admonition any more.</span>
<span class="verse Eccl_4_14" data-osis="Eccl.4.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>For out of prison he came out to be king; yes, even in his kingdom he was born poor.</span>
<span class="verse Eccl_4_15" data-osis="Eccl.4.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>I saw all the living who walk under the sun, that they were with the youth, the other, who succeeded him.</span>
<span class="verse Eccl_4_16" data-osis="Eccl.4.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>There was no end of all the people, even of all them over whom he was&mdash;yet those who come after shall not rejoice in him. Surely this also is vanity and a chasing after wind.</span>

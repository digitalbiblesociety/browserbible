<span class="verse Eph_4_9" data-osis="Eph.4.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>Now this, &ldquo;He ascended,&rdquo; what is it but that he also first descended into the lower parts of the earth?</span>

<span class="verse Eph_4_14" data-osis="Eph.4.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>that we may no longer be children, tossed back and forth and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the trickery of men, in craftiness, after the wiles of error;</span>
<span class="verse Eph_4_15" data-osis="Eph.4.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>but speaking truth in love, we may grow up in all things into him, who is the head, Christ;</span>

<span class="verse Eph_4_18" data-osis="Eph.4.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>being darkened in their understanding, alienated from the life of God, because of the ignorance that is in them, because of the hardening of their hearts;</span>
<span class="verse Eph_4_19" data-osis="Eph.4.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>who having become callous gave themselves up to lust, to work all uncleanness with greediness.</span>

<span class="verse Eph_4_21" data-osis="Eph.4.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>if indeed you heard him, and were taught in him, even as truth is in Jesus:</span>
<span class="verse Eph_4_22" data-osis="Eph.4.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>that you put away, as concerning your former way of life, the old man, that grows corrupt after the lusts of deceit;</span>
<span class="verse Eph_4_23" data-osis="Eph.4.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>and that you be renewed in the spirit of your mind,</span>

<span class="verse Eph_4_28" data-osis="Eph.4.28"><span class="verse-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span>Let him who stole steal no more; but rather let him labor, working with his hands the thing that is good, that he may have something to give to him who has need.</span>
<span class="verse Eph_4_29" data-osis="Eph.4.29"><span class="verse-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span>Let no corrupt speech proceed out of your mouth, but such as is good for building up as the need may be, that it may give grace to those who hear.</span>
<span class="verse Eph_4_30" data-osis="Eph.4.30"><span class="verse-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span>Don&rsquo;t grieve the Holy Spirit of God, in whom you were sealed for the day of redemption.</span>

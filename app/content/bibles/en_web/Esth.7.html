<span class="verse Esth_7_1" data-osis="Esth.7.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>So the king and Haman came to banquet with Esther the queen.</span>
<span class="verse Esth_7_2" data-osis="Esth.7.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>The king said again to Esther on the second day at the banquet of wine, &ldquo;What is your petition, queen Esther? It shall be granted you. What is your request? Even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Esth_7_3" data-osis="Esth.7.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>Then Esther the queen answered, &ldquo;If I have found favor in your sight, O king, and if it please the king, let my life be given me at my petition, and my people at my request.</span>
<span class="verse Esth_7_4" data-osis="Esth.7.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>For we are sold, I and my people, to be destroyed, to be slain, and to perish. But if we had been sold for male and female slaves, I would have held my peace, although the adversary could not have compensated for the king&rsquo;s loss.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Esth_7_5" data-osis="Esth.7.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>Then King Ahasuerus said to Esther the queen, &ldquo;Who is he, and where is he who dared presume in his heart to do so?&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Esth_7_6" data-osis="Esth.7.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>Esther said, &ldquo;An adversary and an enemy, even this wicked Haman!&rdquo;<br>Then Haman was afraid before the king and the queen.</span>
<span class="verse Esth_7_7" data-osis="Esth.7.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>The king arose in his wrath from the banquet of wine and went into the palace garden. Haman stood up to make request for his life to Esther the queen; for he saw that there was evil determined against him by the king.</span>
<span class="verse Esth_7_8" data-osis="Esth.7.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>Then the king returned out of the palace garden into the place of the banquet of wine; and Haman had fallen on the couch where Esther was. Then the king said, &ldquo;Will he even assault the queen in front of me in the house?&rdquo; As the word went out of the king&rsquo;s mouth, they covered Haman&rsquo;s face.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Esth_7_9" data-osis="Esth.7.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>Then Harbonah, one of the eunuchs who were with the king said, &ldquo;Behold, the gallows fifty cubits high, which Haman has made for Mordecai, who spoke good for the king, is standing at Haman&rsquo;s house.&rdquo;<br>The king said, “Hang him on it!”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Esth_7_10" data-osis="Esth.7.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai. Then was the king&rsquo;s wrath pacified.</span>

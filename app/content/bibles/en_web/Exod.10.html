<span class="verse" data-osis="Exod.10.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>and that you may tell in the hearing of your son, and of your son&rsquo;s son, what things I have done to Egypt, and my signs which I have done among them; that you may know that I am Yahweh.&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Exod.10.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>Moses and Aaron went in to Pharaoh, and said to him, &ldquo;This is what Yahweh, the God of the Hebrews, says: &lsquo;How long will you refuse to humble yourself before me? Let my people go, that they may serve me.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Exod.10.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>Or else, if you refuse to let my people go, behold, tomorrow I will bring locusts into your country,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Exod.10.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>and they shall cover the surface of the earth, so that one won&rsquo;t be able to see the earth.

<span class="verse" data-osis="Exod.10.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>Your houses shall be filled, and the houses of all your servants, and the houses of all the Egyptians; as neither your fathers nor your fathers&rsquo; fathers have seen, since the day that they were on the earth to this day.&rsquo;&rdquo; He turned, and went out from Pharaoh.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Exod.10.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span>Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron in haste, and he said, &ldquo;I have sinned against Yahweh your God, and against you.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Exod.36.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Bezalel and Oholiab shall work with every wise-hearted man, in whom Yahweh has put wisdom and understanding to know how to work all the work for the service of the sanctuary, according to all that Yahweh has commanded.&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Exod.36.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>Moses called Bezalel and Oholiab, and every wise-hearted man, in whose heart Yahweh had put wisdom, even everyone whose heart stirred him up to come to the work to do it:</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Exod.36.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>and they received from Moses all the offering which the children of Israel had brought for the work of the service of the sanctuary, with which to make it. They brought yet to him freewill offerings every morning.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Exod.36.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>All the wise men, who performed all the work of the sanctuary, each came from his work which they did.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Exod.36.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>For the stuff they had was sufficient for all the work to make it, and too much.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Exod.36.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>All the wise-hearted men among those who did the work made the tabernacle with ten curtains; of fine twined linen, blue, purple, and scarlet, with cherubim, the work of the skillful workman, they made them.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Exod.36.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>The length of each curtain was twenty-eight cubits, and the breadth of each curtain four cubits. All the curtains had one measure.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Exod.36.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>He made fifty clasps of gold, and coupled the curtains one to another with the clasps: so the tabernacle was a unit.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Exod.36.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>He made curtains of goats&rsquo; hair for a covering over the tabernacle. He made them eleven curtains.</span>

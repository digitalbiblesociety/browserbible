<span class="verse Ezek_22_5" data-osis="Ezek.22.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>Those who are near, and those who are far from you, shall mock you, you infamous one, full of tumult.</span>

<span class="verse Ezek_22_7" data-osis="Ezek.22.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>In you have they set light by father and mother; in your midst have they dealt by oppression with the foreigner; in you have they wronged the fatherless and the widow.</span>
<span class="verse Ezek_22_8" data-osis="Ezek.22.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>You have despised my holy things, and have profaned my Sabbaths.</span>

<span class="verse Ezek_22_10" data-osis="Ezek.22.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>In you have they uncovered their fathers&rsquo; nakedness; in you have they humbled her who was unclean in her impurity.</span>
<span class="verse Ezek_22_11" data-osis="Ezek.22.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>One has committed abomination with his neighbor&rsquo;s wife; and another has lewdly defiled his daughter-in-law; and another in you has humbled his sister, his father&rsquo;s daughter.</span>
<span class="verse Ezek_22_12" data-osis="Ezek.22.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>In you have they taken bribes to shed blood; you have taken interest and increase, and you have greedily gained of your neighbors by oppression, and have forgotten me, says the Lord Yahweh.</span>
<span class="verse Ezek_22_13" data-osis="Ezek.22.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>Behold, therefore, I have struck my hand at your dishonest gain which you have made, and at your blood which has been in your midst.</span>

<span class="verse Ezek_22_18" data-osis="Ezek.22.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>Son of man, the house of Israel has become dross to me: all of them are brass and tin and iron and lead, in the midst of the furnace; they are the dross of silver.</span>
<span class="verse Ezek_22_19" data-osis="Ezek.22.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh: Because you have all become dross, therefore, behold, I will gather you into the midst of Jerusalem.</span>
<span class="verse Ezek_22_20" data-osis="Ezek.22.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>As they gather silver and brass and iron and lead and tin into the midst of the furnace, to blow the fire on it, to melt it; so will I gather you in my anger and in my wrath, and I will lay you there, and melt you.</span>
<span class="verse Ezek_22_21" data-osis="Ezek.22.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>Yes, I will gather you, and blow on you with the fire of my wrath, and you shall be melted in its midst.</span>
<span class="verse Ezek_22_22" data-osis="Ezek.22.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>As silver is melted in the midst of the furnace, so you will be melted in its midst; and you will know that I, Yahweh, have poured out my wrath on you.</span>

<span class="verse Ezek_22_25" data-osis="Ezek.22.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span>There is a conspiracy of her prophets in its midst, like a roaring lion ravening the prey: they have devoured souls; they take treasure and precious things; they have made her widows many in its midst.</span>
<span class="verse Ezek_22_26" data-osis="Ezek.22.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span>Her priests have done violence to my law, and have profaned my holy things: they have made no distinction between the holy and the common, neither have they caused men to discern between the unclean and the clean, and have hidden their eyes from my Sabbaths, and I am profaned among them.</span>
<span class="verse Ezek_22_27" data-osis="Ezek.22.27"><span class="verse-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span>Her princes in its midst are like wolves ravening the prey, to shed blood, and to destroy souls, that they may get dishonest gain.</span>

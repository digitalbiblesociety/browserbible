<span class="verse Ezek_29_6" data-osis="Ezek.29.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>All the inhabitants of Egypt will know that I am Yahweh, because they have been a staff of reed to the house of Israel.</span>

<span class="verse Ezek_29_13" data-osis="Ezek.29.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>For thus says the Lord Yahweh: &ldquo;At the end of forty years will I gather the Egyptians from the peoples where they were scattered;</span>

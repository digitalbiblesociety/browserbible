<span class="verse" data-osis="Ezek.32.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>Son of man, take up a lamentation over Pharaoh king of Egypt, and tell him, You were likened to a young lion of the nations: yet you are as a monster in the seas; and you broke out with your rivers, and troubled the waters with your feet, and fouled their rivers.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Ezek.32.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>Thus says the Lord Yahweh: I will spread out my net on you with a company of many peoples; and they shall bring you up in my net.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Ezek.32.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>I will leave you on the land, I will cast you out on the open field, and will cause all the birds of the sky to settle on you, and I will satisfy the animals of the whole earth with you.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Ezek.32.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>I will lay your flesh on the mountains, and fill the valleys with your height.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Ezek.32.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>I will also water with your blood the land in which you swim, even to the mountains; and the watercourses shall be full of you.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Ezek.32.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>When I shall extinguish you, I will cover the heavens, and make its stars dark; I will cover the sun with a cloud, and the moon shall not give its light.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Ezek.32.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>All the bright lights of the sky will I make dark over you, and set darkness on your land, says the Lord Yahweh.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Ezek.32.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>I will also trouble the hearts of many peoples, when I shall bring your destruction among the nations, into the countries which you have not known.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Ezek.32.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>Yes, I will make many peoples amazed at you, and their kings shall be horribly afraid for you, when I shall brandish my sword before them; and they shall tremble at every moment, every man for his own life, in the day of your fall.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Ezek.32.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>For thus says the Lord Yahweh: The sword of the king of Babylon shall come on you.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Ezek.32.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>By the swords of the mighty will I cause your multitude to fall; the terrible of the nations are they all: and they shall bring to nothing the pride of Egypt, and all its multitude shall be destroyed.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Ezek.32.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>I will destroy also all its animals from beside many waters; neither shall the foot of man trouble them any more, nor the hoofs of animals trouble them.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Ezek.32.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>When I shall make the land of Egypt desolate and waste, a land destitute of that of which it was full, when I shall strike all those who dwell therein, then shall they know that I am Yahweh.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Ezek.32.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span>This is the lamentation with which they shall lament; the daughters of the nations shall lament therewith; over Egypt, and over all her multitude, shall they lament therewith, says the Lord Yahweh.</span>

<span class="verse Ezek_38_4" data-osis="Ezek.38.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>and I will turn you around, and put hooks into your jaws, and I will bring you out, with all your army, horses and horsemen, all of them clothed in full armor, a great company with buckler and shield, all of them handling swords;</span>
<span class="verse Ezek_38_5" data-osis="Ezek.38.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>Persia, Cush, and Put with them, all of them with shield and helmet;</span>

<span class="verse Ezek_38_8" data-osis="Ezek.38.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>After many days you shall be visited: in the latter years you shall come into the land that is brought back from the sword, that is gathered out of many peoples, on the mountains of Israel, which have been a continual waste; but it is brought out of the peoples, and they shall dwell securely, all of them.</span>
<span class="verse Ezek_38_9" data-osis="Ezek.38.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>You shall ascend, you shall come like a storm, you shall be like a cloud to cover the land, you, and all your hordes, and many peoples with you.</span>
<span class="verse Ezek_38_10" data-osis="Ezek.38.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>Thus says the Lord Yahweh: It shall happen in that day, that things shall come into your mind, and you shall devise an evil device:</span>

<span class="verse Ezek_38_12" data-osis="Ezek.38.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>to take the plunder and to take the prey; to turn your hand against the waste places that are inhabited, and against the people who are gathered out of the nations, who have gotten livestock and goods, who dwell in the middle of the earth.</span>
<span class="verse Ezek_38_13" data-osis="Ezek.38.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>Sheba, and Dedan, and the merchants of Tarshish, with all the young lions of it, shall tell you, Have you come to take the plunder? have you assembled your company to take the prey? to carry away silver and gold, to take away livestock and goods, to take great plunder?</span>
<span class="verse Ezek_38_14" data-osis="Ezek.38.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>Therefore, son of man, prophesy, and tell Gog, Thus says the Lord Yahweh: In that day when my people Israel dwells securely, shall you not know it?</span>

<span class="verse Ezek_38_16" data-osis="Ezek.38.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>and you shall come up against my people Israel, as a cloud to cover the land: it shall happen in the latter days, that I will bring you against my land, that the nations may know me, when I shall be sanctified in you, Gog, before their eyes.</span>
<span class="verse Ezek_38_17" data-osis="Ezek.38.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>Thus says the Lord Yahweh: Are you he of whom I spoke in old time by my servants the prophets of Israel, who prophesied in those days for years that I would bring you against them?</span>
<span class="verse Ezek_38_18" data-osis="Ezek.38.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>It shall happen in that day, when Gog shall come against the land of Israel, says the Lord Yahweh, that my wrath shall come up into my nostrils.</span>
<span class="verse Ezek_38_19" data-osis="Ezek.38.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>For in my jealousy and in the fire of my wrath have I spoken, Surely in that day there shall be a great shaking in the land of Israel;</span>

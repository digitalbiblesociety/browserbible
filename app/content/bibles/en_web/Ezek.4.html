<span class="verse" data-osis="Ezek.4.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>You also, son of man, take a tile, and lay it before yourself, and portray on it a city, even Jerusalem:</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Ezek.4.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>and lay siege against it, and build forts against it, and cast up a mound against it; set camps also against it, and plant battering rams against it all around.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Ezek.4.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>Take for yourself an iron pan, and set it for a wall of iron between you and the city: and set your face toward it, and it shall be besieged, and you shall lay siege against it. This shall be a sign to the house of Israel.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Ezek.4.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>Moreover lie on your left side, and lay the iniquity of the house of Israel on it; according to the number of the days that you shall lie on it, you shall bear their iniquity.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Ezek.4.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>For I have appointed the years of their iniquity to be to you a number of days, even three hundred ninety days: so you shall bear the iniquity of the house of Israel.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Ezek.4.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>Again, when you have accomplished these, you shall lie on your right side, and shall bear the iniquity of the house of Judah: forty days, each day for a year, have I appointed it to you.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Ezek.4.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>You shall set your face toward the siege of Jerusalem, with your arm uncovered; and you shall prophesy against it.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Ezek.4.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>Behold, I lay bands on you, and you shall not turn you from one side to the other, until you have accomplished the days of your siege.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Ezek.4.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>Take for yourself also wheat, and barley, and beans, and lentils, and millet, and spelt, and put them in one vessel, and make bread of it; according to the number of the days that you shall lie on your side, even three hundred ninety days, you shall eat of it.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Ezek.4.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>Your food which you shall eat shall be by weight, twenty shekels a day: from time to time you shall eat it.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Ezek.4.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>You shall drink water by measure, the sixth part of a hin: from time to time you shall drink.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Ezek.4.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>You shall eat it as barley cakes, and you shall bake it in their sight with dung that comes out of man.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Ezek.4.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>Yahweh said, Even thus shall the children of Israel eat their bread unclean, among the nations where I will drive them.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Ezek.4.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>Then I said, Ah Lord Yahweh! behold, my soul has not been polluted; for from my youth up even until now have I not eaten of that which dies of itself, or is torn of animals; neither came there abominable flesh into my mouth.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Ezek.4.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>Then he said to me, Behold, I have given you cow&rsquo;s dung for man&rsquo;s dung, and you shall prepare your bread on it.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Ezek.4.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span>Moreover he said to me, Son of man, behold, I will break the staff of bread in Jerusalem: and they shall eat bread by weight, and with fearfulness; and they shall drink water by measure, and in dismay:</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Ezek.4.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span>that they may want bread and water, and be dismayed one with another, and pine away in their iniquity.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Ezek.44.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>Then he brought me back by the way of the outer gate of the sanctuary, which looks toward the east; and it was shut.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Ezek.44.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>Yahweh said to me, This gate shall be shut; it shall not be opened, neither shall any man enter in by it; for Yahweh, the God of Israel, has entered in by it; therefore it shall be shut.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Ezek.44.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>As for the prince, he shall sit therein as prince to eat bread before Yahweh; he shall enter by the way of the porch of the gate, and shall go out by the way of the same.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Ezek.44.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>Then he brought me by the way of the north gate before the house; and I looked, and behold, Yahweh&rsquo;s glory filled the house of Yahweh: and I fell on my face.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Ezek.44.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>Yahweh said to me, Son of man, mark well, and see with your eyes, and hear with your ears all that I tell you concerning all the ordinances of the house of Yahweh, and all its laws; and mark well the entrance of the house, with every exit of the sanctuary.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Ezek.44.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>You shall tell the rebellious, even to the house of Israel, Thus says the Lord Yahweh: you house of Israel, let it suffice you of all your abominations,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Ezek.44.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>in that you have brought in foreigners, uncircumcised in heart and uncircumcised in flesh, to be in my sanctuary, to profane it, even my house, when you offer my bread, the fat and the blood, and they have broken my covenant, \add to add\add* to all your abominations.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Ezek.44.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>You have not performed the duty of my holy things; but you have set performers of my duty in my sanctuary for yourselves.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Ezek.44.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>Thus says the Lord Yahweh, No foreigner, uncircumcised in heart and uncircumcised in flesh, shall enter into my sanctuary, of any foreigners who are among the children of Israel.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Ezek.44.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>But the Levites who went far from me, when Israel went astray, who went astray from me after their idols, they shall bear their iniquity.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Ezek.44.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>Yet they shall be ministers in my sanctuary, having oversight at the gates of the house, and ministering in the house: they shall kill the burnt offering and the sacrifice for the people, and they shall stand before them to minister to them.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Ezek.44.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>Because they ministered to them before their idols, and became a stumbling block of iniquity to the house of Israel; therefore have I lifted up my hand against them, says the Lord Yahweh, and they shall bear their iniquity.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Ezek.44.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>They shall not come near to me, to execute the office of priest to me, nor to come near to any of my holy things, to the things that are most holy; but they shall bear their shame, and their abominations which they have committed.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Ezek.44.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>Yet will I make them performers of the duty of the house, for all its service, and for all that shall be done therein.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Ezek.44.25"><span class="verse-num">25&nbsp;</span>They shall go in to no dead person to defile themselves; but for father, or for mother, or for son, or for daughter, for brother, or for sister who has had no husband, they may defile themselves.</span>

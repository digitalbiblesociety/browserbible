<span class="verse" data-osis="Ezek.7.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>Moreover the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Ezek.7.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>You, son of man, thus says the Lord Yahweh to the land of Israel, An end: the end has come on the four corners of the land.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Ezek.7.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>Now is the end on you, and I will send my anger on you, and will judge you according to your ways; and I will bring on you all your abominations.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Ezek.7.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>My eye shall not spare you, neither will I have pity; but I will bring your ways on you, and your abominations shall be in your midst: and you shall know that I am Yahweh.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Ezek.7.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>Thus says the Lord Yahweh: An evil, an only evil; behold, it comes.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Ezek.7.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>An end has come, the end has come; it awakes against you; behold, it comes.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Ezek.7.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>Your doom has come to you, inhabitant of the land: the time has come, the day is near, a day of tumult, and not of joyful shouting, on the mountains.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Ezek.7.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>Now will I shortly pour out my wrath on you, and accomplish my anger against you, and will judge you according to your ways; and I will bring on you all your abominations.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Ezek.7.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>My eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity: I will bring on you according to your ways; and your abominations shall be in your midst; and you shall know that I, Yahweh, do strike.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Ezek.7.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>Behold, the day, behold, it comes: your doom has gone out; the rod has blossomed, pride has budded.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Ezek.7.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>Violence has risen up into a rod of wickedness. None of them shall remain, nor of their multitude, nor of their wealth. There shall be nothing of value among them.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Ezek.7.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>The time has come, the day draws near: don&rsquo;t let the buyer rejoice, nor the seller mourn; for wrath is on all its multitude.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Ezek.7.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>For the seller shall not return to that which is sold, although they be yet alive: for the vision is touching the whole multitude of it, none shall return; neither shall any strengthen himself in the iniquity of his life.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Ezek.7.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>They have blown the trumpet, and have made all ready; but no one goes to the battle; for my wrath is on all its multitude.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Ezek.7.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>The sword is outside, and the pestilence and the famine within: he who is in the field shall die with the sword: and he who is in the city, famine and pestilence shall devour him.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Ezek.7.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span>But those of those who escape shall escape, and shall be on the mountains like doves of the valleys, all of them moaning, every one in his iniquity.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Ezek.7.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span>All hands shall be feeble, and all knees shall be weak as water.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Ezek.7.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span>They shall also clothe themselves with sackcloth, and horror shall cover them; and shame shall be on all faces, and baldness on all their heads.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Ezek.7.19"><span class="verse-num">19&nbsp;</span>They shall cast their silver in the streets, and their gold shall be as an unclean thing; their silver and their gold shall not be able to deliver them in the day of the wrath of Yahweh: they shall not satisfy their souls, neither fill their bowels; because it has been the stumbling block of their iniquity.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Ezek.7.20"><span class="verse-num">20&nbsp;</span>As for the beauty of his ornament, he set it in majesty; but they made the images of their abominations and their detestable things therein: therefore have I made it to them as an unclean thing.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Ezek.7.21"><span class="verse-num">21&nbsp;</span>I will give it into the hands of the strangers for a prey, and to the wicked of the earth for a plunder; and they shall profane it.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Ezek.7.22"><span class="verse-num">22&nbsp;</span>My face will I turn also from them, and they shall profane my secret place; and robbers shall enter into it, and profane it.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Ezek.7.23"><span class="verse-num">23&nbsp;</span>Make the chain; for the land is full of bloody crimes, and the city is full of violence.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Ezek.7.24"><span class="verse-num">24&nbsp;</span>Therefore I will bring the worst of the nations, and they shall possess their houses: I will also make the pride of the strong to cease; and their holy places shall be profaned.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Ezek.7.25"><span class="verse-num">25&nbsp;</span>Destruction comes; and they shall seek peace, and there shall be none.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Ezek.7.26"><span class="verse-num">26&nbsp;</span>Mischief shall come on mischief, and rumor shall be on rumor; and they shall seek a vision of the prophet; but the law shall perish from the priest, and counsel from the elders.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Ezek.7.27"><span class="verse-num">27&nbsp;</span>The king shall mourn, and the prince shall be clothed with desolation, and the hands of the people of the land shall be troubled: I will do to them after their way, and according to their own judgments will I judge them; and they shall know that I am Yahweh.</span>

<span class="verse Ezek_9_1" data-osis="Ezek.9.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>Then he cried in my ears with a loud voice, saying, Cause those who are in charge of the city to draw near, every man with his destroying weapon in his hand.</span>
<span class="verse Ezek_9_2" data-osis="Ezek.9.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>Behold, six men came from the way of the upper gate, which lies toward the north, every man with his slaughter weapon in his hand; and one man in their midst clothed in linen, with a writer&rsquo;s inkhorn by his side. They went in, and stood beside the bronze altar.</span>
<span class="verse Ezek_9_3" data-osis="Ezek.9.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>The glory of the God of Israel was gone up from the cherub, whereupon it was, to the threshold of the house: and he called to the man clothed in linen, who had the writer&rsquo;s inkhorn by his side.</span>
<span class="verse Ezek_9_4" data-osis="Ezek.9.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>Yahweh said to him, Go through the midst of the city, through the midst of Jerusalem, and set a mark on the foreheads of the men that sigh and that cry over all the abominations that are done in its midst.</span>
<span class="verse Ezek_9_5" data-osis="Ezek.9.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>To the others he said in my hearing, Go through the city after him, and strike: don&rsquo;t let your eye spare, neither have pity;</span>
<span class="verse Ezek_9_6" data-osis="Ezek.9.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>kill utterly the old man, the young man and the virgin, and little children and women; but don&rsquo;t come near any man on whom is the mark: and begin at my sanctuary. Then they began at the old men that were before the house.</span>
<span class="verse Ezek_9_7" data-osis="Ezek.9.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>He said to them, Defile the house, and fill the courts with the slain. Go out! They went out, and struck in the city.</span>
<span class="verse Ezek_9_8" data-osis="Ezek.9.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>It happened, while they were smiting, and I was left, that I fell on my face, and cried, and said, Ah Lord Yahweh! will you destroy all the residue of Israel in your pouring out of your wrath on Jerusalem?</span>
<span class="verse Ezek_9_9" data-osis="Ezek.9.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>Then he said to me, The iniquity of the house of Israel and Judah is exceedingly great, and the land is full of blood, and the city full of perversion: for they say, Yahweh has forsaken the land, and Yahweh doesn&rsquo;t see.</span>
<span class="verse Ezek_9_10" data-osis="Ezek.9.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>As for me also, my eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity, but I will bring their way on their head.</span>
<span class="verse Ezek_9_11" data-osis="Ezek.9.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>Behold, the man clothed in linen, who had the inkhorn by his side, reported the matter, saying, I have done as you have commanded me.</span>

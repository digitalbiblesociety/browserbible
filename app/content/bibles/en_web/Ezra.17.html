<span class="verse" data-osis="Ezra.17.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>He placed forces in all the fortified cities of Judah, and set garrisons in the land of Judah, and in the cities of Ephraim, which Asa his father had taken.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Ezra.17.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>Yahweh was with Jehoshaphat, because he walked in the first ways of his father David, and didn&rsquo;t seek the Baals,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Ezra.17.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>but sought to the God of his father, and walked in his commandments, and not after the doings of Israel.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Ezra.17.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>Therefore Yahweh established the kingdom in his hand; and all Judah brought to Jehoshaphat tribute; and he had riches and honor in abundance.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Ezra.17.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>His heart was lifted up in the ways of Yahweh: and furthermore he took away the high places and the Asherah poles out of Judah.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Ezra.17.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>Also in the third year of his reign he sent his princes, even Ben Hail, and Obadiah, and Zechariah, and Nethanel, and Micaiah, to teach in the cities of Judah;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Ezra.17.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>and with them the Levites, even Shemaiah, and Nethaniah, and Zebadiah, and Asahel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehonathan, and Adonijah, and Tobijah, and Tobadonijah, the Levites; and with them Elishama and Jehoram, the priests.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Ezra.17.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>They taught in Judah, having the book of the law of Yahweh with them; and they went about throughout all the cities of Judah, and taught among the people.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Ezra.17.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>The fear of Yahweh fell on all the kingdoms of the lands that were around Judah, so that they made no war against Jehoshaphat.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Ezra.17.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>Some of the Philistines brought Jehoshaphat presents, and silver for tribute; the Arabians also brought him flocks, seven thousand and seven hundred rams, and seven thousand and seven hundred male goats.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Ezra.17.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>Jehoshaphat grew great exceedingly; and he built in Judah castles and cities of store.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Ezra.17.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>He had many works in the cities of Judah; and men of war, mighty men of valor, in Jerusalem.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Ezra.17.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>This was the numbering of them according to their fathers&rsquo; houses: Of Judah, the captains of thousands: Adnah the captain, and with him mighty men of valor three hundred thousand;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Ezra.17.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>and next to him Jehohanan the captain, and with him two hundred eighty thousand;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Ezra.17.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span>and next to him Amasiah the son of Zichri, who willingly offered himself to Yahweh; and with him two hundred thousand mighty men of valor.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Ezra.17.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span>Of Benjamin: Eliada a mighty man of valor, and with him two hundred thousand armed with bow and shield;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Ezra.17.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span>and next to him Jehozabad and with him one hundred eighty thousand ready prepared for war.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Ezra.17.19"><span class="verse-num">19&nbsp;</span>These were those who waited on the king, besides those whom the king put in the fortified cities throughout all Judah.</span>

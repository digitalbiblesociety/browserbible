<span class="verse Ezra_4_1" data-osis="Ezra.4.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>Now when the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin heard that the children of the captivity were building a temple to Yahweh, the God of Israel;</span>
<span class="verse Ezra_4_2" data-osis="Ezra.4.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>then they drew near to Zerubbabel, and to the heads of fathers&rsquo; households, and said to them, &ldquo;Let us build with you; for we seek your God, as you do; and we sacrifice to him since the days of Esar Haddon king of Assyria, who brought us up here.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Ezra_4_3" data-osis="Ezra.4.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>But Zerubbabel, and Jeshua, and the rest of the heads of fathers&rsquo; households of Israel, said to them, &ldquo;You have nothing to do with us in building a house to our God; but we ourselves together will build to Yahweh, the God of Israel, as king Cyrus the king of Persia has commanded us.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Ezra_4_4" data-osis="Ezra.4.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>Then the people of the land weakened the hands of the people of Judah, and troubled them in building,</span>
<span class="verse Ezra_4_5" data-osis="Ezra.4.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>and hired counselors against them, to frustrate their purpose, all the days of Cyrus king of Persia, even until the reign of Darius king of Persia.</span>
<span class="verse Ezra_4_6" data-osis="Ezra.4.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>In the reign of Ahasuerus, in the beginning of his reign, wrote they an accusation against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem.</span>
<span class="verse Ezra_4_7" data-osis="Ezra.4.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>In the days of Artaxerxes wrote Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel, and the rest of his companions, to Artaxerxes king of Persia; and the writing of the letter was written in Syrian, and delivered in the Syrian language.</span>
<span class="verse Ezra_4_8" data-osis="Ezra.4.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>Rehum the chancellor and Shimshai the scribe wrote a letter against Jerusalem to Artaxerxes the king in this sort:</span>
<span class="verse Ezra_4_9" data-osis="Ezra.4.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>then Rehum the chancellor, and Shimshai the scribe, and the rest of their companions, the Dinaites, and the Apharsathchites, the Tarpelites, the Apharsites, the Archevites, the Babylonians, the Shushanchites, the Dehaites, the Elamites,</span>
<span class="verse Ezra_4_10" data-osis="Ezra.4.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>and the rest of the nations whom the great and noble Osnappar brought over, and set in the city of Samaria, and in the rest of the country beyond the River, and so forth, wrote.</span>
<span class="verse Ezra_4_11" data-osis="Ezra.4.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>This is the copy of the letter that they sent to Artaxerxes the king: Your servants the men beyond the River, and so forth.</span>
<span class="verse Ezra_4_12" data-osis="Ezra.4.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>Be it known to the king, that the Jews who came up from you have come to us to Jerusalem; they are building the rebellious and the bad city, and have finished the walls, and repaired the foundations.</span>
<span class="verse Ezra_4_13" data-osis="Ezra.4.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>Be it known now to the king that if this city is built, and the walls finished, they will not pay tribute, custom, or toll, and in the end it will be hurtful to the kings.</span>
<span class="verse Ezra_4_14" data-osis="Ezra.4.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>Now because we eat the salt of the palace, and it is not appropriate for us to see the king&rsquo;s dishonor, therefore have we sent and informed the king;</span>
<span class="verse Ezra_4_15" data-osis="Ezra.4.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>that search may be made in the book of the records of your fathers: so you shall find in the book of the records, and know that this city is a rebellious city, and hurtful to kings and provinces, and that they have moved sedition within the same of old time; for which cause was this city laid waste.</span>
<span class="verse Ezra_4_16" data-osis="Ezra.4.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>We inform the king that, if this city be built, and the walls finished, by this means you shall have no portion beyond the River.</span>
<span class="verse Ezra_4_17" data-osis="Ezra.4.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>Then the king sent an answer to Rehum the chancellor, and to Shimshai the scribe, and to the rest of their companions who dwell in Samaria, and in the rest of the country beyond the River: Peace, and so forth.</span>
<span class="verse Ezra_4_18" data-osis="Ezra.4.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>The letter which you sent to us has been plainly read before me.</span>
<span class="verse Ezra_4_19" data-osis="Ezra.4.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>I decreed, and search has been made, and it is found that this city of old time has made insurrection against kings, and that rebellion and sedition have been made therein.</span>
<span class="verse Ezra_4_20" data-osis="Ezra.4.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>There have been mighty kings also over Jerusalem, who have ruled over all the country beyond the River; and tribute, custom, and toll, was paid to them.</span>
<span class="verse Ezra_4_21" data-osis="Ezra.4.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>Make a decree now to cause these men to cease, and that this city not be built, until a decree shall be made by me.</span>
<span class="verse Ezra_4_22" data-osis="Ezra.4.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>Take heed that you not be slack herein: why should damage grow to the hurt of the kings?</span>
<span class="verse Ezra_4_23" data-osis="Ezra.4.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>Then when the copy of king Artaxerxes&rsquo; letter was read before Rehum, and Shimshai the scribe, and their companions, they went in haste to Jerusalem to the Jews, and made them to cease by force and power.</span>
<span class="verse Ezra_4_24" data-osis="Ezra.4.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span>Then ceased the work of God&rsquo;s house which is at Jerusalem; and it ceased until the second year of the reign of Darius king of Persia.</span>

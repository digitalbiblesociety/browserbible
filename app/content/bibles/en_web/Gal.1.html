<h2 class="chapter-num">1</h2>
<p>
<span class="verse Gal_1_1" data-osis="Gal.1.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>Paul, an apostle (not from men, neither through man, but through Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead),</span>
<span class="verse Gal_1_2" data-osis="Gal.1.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>and all the brothers<span class="note">+<dfn>The word for &ldquo;brothers&rdquo; here and where context allows may also be correctly translated &ldquo;brothers and sisters&rdquo; or &ldquo;siblings.&rdquo;</dfn></span> who are with me, to the assemblies of Galatia:</span>
<span class="verse Gal_1_3" data-osis="Gal.1.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>Grace to you and peace from God the Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ,</span>
<span class="verse Gal_1_4" data-osis="Gal.1.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us out of this present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father&mdash;</span>
<span class="verse Gal_1_5" data-osis="Gal.1.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>to whom be the glory forever and ever. Amen.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Gal_1_6" data-osis="Gal.1.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>I marvel that you are so quickly deserting him who called you in the grace of Christ to a different &ldquo;good news&rdquo;;</span>
<span class="verse Gal_1_7" data-osis="Gal.1.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>and there isn&rsquo;t another &ldquo;good news.&rdquo; Only there are some who trouble you, and want to pervert the Good News of Christ.</span>
<span class="verse Gal_1_8" data-osis="Gal.1.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>But even though we, or an angel from heaven, should preach to you any &ldquo;good news&rdquo; other than that which we preached to you, let him be cursed.</span>
<span class="verse Gal_1_9" data-osis="Gal.1.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>As we have said before, so I now say again: if any man preaches to you any &ldquo;good news&rdquo; other than that which you received, let him be cursed.</span>
<span class="verse Gal_1_10" data-osis="Gal.1.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>For am I now seeking the favor of men, or of God? Or am I striving to please men? For if I were still pleasing men, I wouldn&rsquo;t be a servant of Christ.</span>
<span class="verse Gal_1_11" data-osis="Gal.1.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>But I make known to you, brothers, concerning the Good News which was preached by me, that it is not according to man.</span>
<span class="verse Gal_1_12" data-osis="Gal.1.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>For neither did I receive it from man, nor was I taught it, but it came to me through revelation of Jesus Christ.</span>
<span class="verse Gal_1_13" data-osis="Gal.1.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>For you have heard of my way of living in time past in the Jews&rsquo; religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the assembly of God, and ravaged it.</span>
<span class="verse Gal_1_14" data-osis="Gal.1.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>I advanced in the Jews&rsquo; religion beyond many of my own age among my countrymen, being more exceedingly zealous for the traditions of my fathers.</span>
<span class="verse Gal_1_15" data-osis="Gal.1.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>But when it was the good pleasure of God, who separated me from my mother&rsquo;s womb, and called me through his grace,</span>
<span class="verse Gal_1_16" data-osis="Gal.1.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>to reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the Gentiles, I didn&rsquo;t immediately confer with flesh and blood,</span>
<span class="verse Gal_1_17" data-osis="Gal.1.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me, but I went away into Arabia. Then I returned to Damascus.</span>
<span class="verse Gal_1_18" data-osis="Gal.1.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to visit Peter, and stayed with him fifteen days.</span>
<span class="verse Gal_1_19" data-osis="Gal.1.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>But of the other apostles I saw no one, except James, the Lord&rsquo;s brother.</span>
<span class="verse Gal_1_20" data-osis="Gal.1.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>Now about the things which I write to you, behold,<span class="note">+<dfn>&ldquo;Behold,&rdquo; from &ldquo;ἰδοὺ,&rdquo; means look at, take notice, observe, see, or gaze at. It is often used as an interjection.</dfn></span> before God, I&rsquo;m not lying.</span>
<span class="verse Gal_1_21" data-osis="Gal.1.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>Then I came to the regions of Syria and Cilicia.</span>
<span class="verse Gal_1_22" data-osis="Gal.1.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>I was still unknown by face to the assemblies of Judea which were in Christ,</span>
<span class="verse Gal_1_23" data-osis="Gal.1.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>but they only heard: &ldquo;He who once persecuted us now preaches the faith that he once tried to destroy.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Gal_1_24" data-osis="Gal.1.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span>And they glorified God in me.</span>

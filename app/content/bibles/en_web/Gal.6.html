<span class="verse" data-osis="Gal.6.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>Brothers, even if a man is caught in some fault, you who are spiritual must restore such a one in a spirit of gentleness; looking to yourself so that you also aren&rsquo;t tempted.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Gal.6.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>Bear one another&rsquo;s burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Gal.6.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>For if a man thinks himself to be something when he is nothing, he deceives himself.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Gal.6.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>But let each man test his own work, and then he will take pride in himself and not in his neighbor.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Gal.6.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>For each man will bear his own burden.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Gal.6.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>But let him who is taught in the word share all good things with him who teaches.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Gal.6.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>Don&rsquo;t be deceived. God is not mocked, for whatever a man sows, that he will also reap.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Gal.6.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>For he who sows to his own flesh will from the flesh reap corruption. But he who sows to the Spirit will from the Spirit reap eternal life.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Gal.6.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>Let us not be weary in doing good, for we will reap in due season, if we don&rsquo;t give up.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Gal.6.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>So then, as we have opportunity, let&rsquo;s do what is good toward all men, and especially toward those who are of the household of the faith.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Gal.6.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>See with what large letters I write to you with my own hand.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Gal.6.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>As many as desire to look good in the flesh, they compel you to be circumcised; only that they may not be persecuted for the cross of Christ.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Gal.6.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>For even they who receive circumcision don&rsquo;t keep the law themselves, but they desire to have you circumcised, that they may boast in your flesh.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Gal.6.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>But far be it from me to boast, except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Gal.6.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>For in Christ Jesus neither is circumcision anything, nor uncircumcision, but a new creation.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Gal.6.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span>As many as walk by this rule, peace and mercy be on them, and on God&rsquo;s Israel.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Gal.6.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span>From now on, let no one cause me any trouble, for I bear the marks of the Lord Jesus branded on my body.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Gal.6.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brothers. Amen.</span>

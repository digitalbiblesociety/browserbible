<span class="verse" data-osis="Gen.12.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>Abram traveled, going on still toward the South.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Gen.12.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>There was a famine in the land. Abram went down into Egypt to live as a foreigner there, for the famine was severe in the land.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Gen.12.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>It happened, when he had come near to enter Egypt, that he said to Sarai his wife, &ldquo;See now, I know that you are a beautiful woman to look at.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Gen.12.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>It will happen, when the Egyptians will see you, that they will say, &lsquo;This is his wife.&rsquo; They will kill me, but they will save you alive.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Gen.12.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>Please say that you are my sister, that it may be well with me for your sake, and that my soul may live because of you.&rdquo;</span>

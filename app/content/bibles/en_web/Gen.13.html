<span class="verse Gen_13_1" data-osis="Gen.13.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>Abram went up out of Egypt: he, his wife, all that he had, and Lot with him, into the South.</span>
<span class="verse Gen_13_2" data-osis="Gen.13.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>Abram was very rich in livestock, in silver, and in gold.</span>
<span class="verse Gen_13_3" data-osis="Gen.13.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>He went on his journeys from the South even to Bethel, to the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and Ai,</span>
<span class="verse Gen_13_4" data-osis="Gen.13.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>to the place of the altar, which he had made there at the first. There Abram called on Yahweh&rsquo;s name.</span>
<span class="verse Gen_13_5" data-osis="Gen.13.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>Lot also, who went with Abram, had flocks, and herds, and tents.</span>
<span class="verse Gen_13_6" data-osis="Gen.13.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>The land was not able to bear them, that they might live together: for their substance was great, so that they could not live together.</span>
<span class="verse Gen_13_7" data-osis="Gen.13.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>There was a strife between the herdsmen of Abram&rsquo;s livestock and the herdsmen of Lot&rsquo;s livestock: and the Canaanite and the Perizzite lived in the land at that time.</span>
<span class="verse Gen_13_8" data-osis="Gen.13.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>Abram said to Lot, &ldquo;Please, let there be no strife between me and you, and between my herdsmen and your herdsmen; for we are relatives.</span>
<span class="verse Gen_13_9" data-osis="Gen.13.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>Isn&rsquo;t the whole land before you? Please separate yourself from me. If you go to the left hand, then I will go to the right. Or if you go to the right hand, then I will go to the left.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Gen_13_10" data-osis="Gen.13.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>Lot lifted up his eyes, and saw all the plain of the Jordan, that it was well-watered everywhere, before Yahweh destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, like the garden of Yahweh, like the land of Egypt, as you go to Zoar.</span>
<span class="verse Gen_13_11" data-osis="Gen.13.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>So Lot chose the Plain of the Jordan for himself. Lot traveled east, and they separated themselves the one from the other.</span>
<span class="verse Gen_13_12" data-osis="Gen.13.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>Abram lived in the land of Canaan, and Lot lived in the cities of the plain, and moved his tent as far as Sodom.</span>
<span class="verse Gen_13_13" data-osis="Gen.13.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>Now the men of Sodom were exceedingly wicked and sinners against Yahweh.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Gen_13_14" data-osis="Gen.13.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>Yahweh said to Abram, after Lot was separated from him, &ldquo;Now, lift up your eyes, and look from the place where you are, northward and southward and eastward and westward,</span>
<span class="verse Gen_13_15" data-osis="Gen.13.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>for all the land which you see, I will give to you, and to your offspring forever.</span>
<span class="verse Gen_13_16" data-osis="Gen.13.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>I will make your offspring as the dust of the earth, so that if a man can number the dust of the earth, then your seed may also be numbered.</span>
<span class="verse Gen_13_17" data-osis="Gen.13.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>Arise, walk through the land in its length and in its breadth; for I will give it to you.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Gen_13_18" data-osis="Gen.13.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>Abram moved his tent, and came and lived by the oaks of Mamre, which are in Hebron, and built an altar there to Yahweh.</span>

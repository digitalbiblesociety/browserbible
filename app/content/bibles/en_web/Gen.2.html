<span class="verse Gen_2_5" data-osis="Gen.2.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>No plant of the field was yet in the earth, and no herb of the field had yet sprung up; for Yahweh God had not caused it to rain on the earth. There was not a man to till the ground,</span>
<span class="verse Gen_2_6" data-osis="Gen.2.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>but a mist went up from the earth, and watered the whole surface of the ground.</span>

<span class="verse Gen_2_12" data-osis="Gen.2.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>and the gold of that land is good. Bdellium<span class="note"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">or, aromatic resin</span></span>  and onyx stone are also there.</span>

<span class="verse Gen_2_17" data-osis="Gen.2.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, you shall not eat of it; for in the day that you eat of it you will surely die.&rdquo;</span>

<p>
<span class="verse Gen_2_18" data-osis="Gen.2.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>Yahweh God said, &ldquo;It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him a helper suitable for him.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse Gen_2_20" data-osis="Gen.2.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>The man gave names to all livestock, and to the birds of the sky, and to every animal of the field; but for man there was not found a helper suitable for him.</span>

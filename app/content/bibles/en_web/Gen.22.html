<span class="verse Gen_22_8" data-osis="Gen.22.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>Abraham said, &ldquo;God will provide himself the lamb for a burnt offering, my son.&rdquo; So they both went together.</span>
<span class="verse Gen_22_9" data-osis="Gen.22.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>They came to the place which God had told him of. Abraham built the altar there, and laid the wood in order, bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar, on the wood.</span>

<p>
<span class="verse Gen_22_13" data-osis="Gen.22.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and saw that behind him was a ram caught in the thicket by his horns.

<span class="verse Gen_22_14" data-osis="Gen.22.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>Abraham called the name of that place Yahweh Will Provide<span class="note">+<dfn>or, Yahweh-Jireh, or, Yahweh-Seeing</dfn></span>.

<span class="verse Gen_22_17" data-osis="Gen.22.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>that I will bless you greatly, and I will multiply your seed greatly like the stars of the heavens, and like the sand which is on the seashore. Your seed will possess the gate of his enemies.</span>
<span class="verse Gen_22_18" data-osis="Gen.22.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>In your seed will all the nations of the earth be blessed, because you have obeyed my voice.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse Gen_24_16" data-osis="Gen.24.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>The young lady was very beautiful to look at, a virgin, neither had any man known her. She went down to the spring, filled her pitcher, and came up.</span>
<span class="verse Gen_24_17" data-osis="Gen.24.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>The servant ran to meet her, and said, &ldquo;Please give me a drink, a little water from your pitcher.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse Gen_24_30" data-osis="Gen.24.30"><span class="verse-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span>It happened, when he saw the ring, and the bracelets on his sister&rsquo;s hands, and when he heard the words of Rebekah his sister, saying, &ldquo;This is what the man said to me,&rdquo; that he came to the man. Behold, he was standing by the camels at the spring.</span>
<span class="verse Gen_24_31" data-osis="Gen.24.31"><span class="verse-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span>He said, &ldquo;Come in, you blessed of Yahweh. Why do you stand outside? For I have prepared the house, and room for the camels.&rdquo;</span>

<p>
<span class="verse Gen_24_32" data-osis="Gen.24.32"><span class="verse-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span>The man came into the house, and he unloaded the camels. He gave straw and provender for the camels, and water to wash his feet and the feet of the men who were with him.</span>
<span class="verse Gen_24_33" data-osis="Gen.24.33"><span class="verse-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span>Food was set before him to eat, but he said, &ldquo;I will not eat until I have told my message.&rdquo;<br>He said, “Speak on.”</span>

<span class="verse Gen_24_45" data-osis="Gen.24.45"><span class="verse-num v-45">45&nbsp;</span>Before I had finished speaking in my heart, behold, Rebekah came out with her pitcher on her shoulder. She went down to the spring, and drew. I said to her, &lsquo;Please let me drink.&rsquo;</span>
<span class="verse Gen_24_46" data-osis="Gen.24.46"><span class="verse-num v-46">46&nbsp;</span>She hurried and let down her pitcher from her shoulder, and said, &lsquo;Drink, and I will also give your camels a drink.&rsquo; So I drank, and she also gave the camels a drink.</span>
<span class="verse Gen_24_47" data-osis="Gen.24.47"><span class="verse-num v-47">47&nbsp;</span>I asked her, and said, &lsquo;Whose daughter are you?&rsquo; She said, &lsquo;The daughter of Bethuel, Nahor&rsquo;s son, whom Milcah bore to him.&rsquo; I put the ring on her nose, and the bracelets on her hands.</span>
<span class="verse Gen_24_48" data-osis="Gen.24.48"><span class="verse-num v-48">48&nbsp;</span>I bowed my head, and worshiped Yahweh, and blessed Yahweh, the God of my master Abraham, who had led me in the right way to take my master&rsquo;s brother&rsquo;s daughter for his son.</span>

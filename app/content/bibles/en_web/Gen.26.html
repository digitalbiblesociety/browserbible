<span class="verse Gen_26_1" data-osis="Gen.26.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>There was a famine in the land, besides the first famine that was in the days of Abraham. Isaac went to Abimelech king of the Philistines, to Gerar.</span>
<span class="verse Gen_26_2" data-osis="Gen.26.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>Yahweh appeared to him, and said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go down into Egypt. Live in the land I will tell you about.</span>
<span class="verse Gen_26_3" data-osis="Gen.26.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>Live in this land, and I will be with you, and will bless you. For to you, and to your seed, I will give all these lands, and I will establish the oath which I swore to Abraham your father.</span>
<span class="verse Gen_26_4" data-osis="Gen.26.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>I will multiply your seed as the stars of the sky, and will give to your seed all these lands. In your seed will all the nations of the earth be blessed,</span>
<span class="verse Gen_26_5" data-osis="Gen.26.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>because Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my requirements, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse Gen_26_7" data-osis="Gen.26.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>The men of the place asked him about his wife. He said, &ldquo;She is my sister,&rdquo; for he was afraid to say, &ldquo;My wife,&rdquo; lest, he thought, &ldquo;the men of the place might kill me for Rebekah, because she is beautiful to look at.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Gen_26_8" data-osis="Gen.26.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>It happened, when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window, and saw, and, behold, Isaac was caressing Rebekah, his wife.</span>
<span class="verse Gen_26_9" data-osis="Gen.26.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>Abimelech called Isaac, and said, &ldquo;Behold, surely she is your wife. Why did you say, &lsquo;She is my sister?&rsquo;&rdquo;</span>

<p>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Gen_26_10" data-osis="Gen.26.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>Abimelech said, &ldquo;What is this you have done to us? One of the people might easily have lain with your wife, and you would have brought guilt on us!&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Gen_26_11" data-osis="Gen.26.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>Abimelech commanded all the people, saying, &ldquo;He who touches this man or his wife will surely be put to death.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Gen_26_12" data-osis="Gen.26.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>Isaac sowed in that land, and reaped in the same year one hundred times what he planted. Yahweh blessed him.</span>
<span class="verse Gen_26_13" data-osis="Gen.26.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>The man grew great, and grew more and more until he became very great.</span>

<span class="verse Gen_26_15" data-osis="Gen.26.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>Now all the wells which his father&rsquo;s servants had dug in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped, and filled with earth.</span>
<span class="verse Gen_26_16" data-osis="Gen.26.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>Abimelech said to Isaac, &ldquo;Go from us, for you are much mightier than we.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse Gen_26_18" data-osis="Gen.26.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>Isaac dug again the wells of water, which they had dug in the days of Abraham his father.

<span class="verse Gen_26_21" data-osis="Gen.26.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>They dug another well, and they argued over that, also. He called its name Sitnah.</span>
<span class="verse Gen_26_22" data-osis="Gen.26.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>He left that place, and dug another well. They didn&rsquo;t argue over that one. He called it Rehoboth.

<span class="verse Gen_26_25" data-osis="Gen.26.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span>He built an altar there, and called on Yahweh&rsquo;s name, and pitched his tent there. There Isaac&rsquo;s servants dug a well.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Gen_26_26" data-osis="Gen.26.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span>Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath his friend, and Phicol the captain of his army.</span>
<span class="verse Gen_26_27" data-osis="Gen.26.27"><span class="verse-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span>Isaac said to them, &ldquo;Why have you come to me, since you hate me, and have sent me away from you?&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Gen_26_28" data-osis="Gen.26.28"><span class="verse-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span>They said, &ldquo;We saw plainly that Yahweh was with you. We said, &lsquo;Let there now be an oath between us, even between us and you, and let us make a covenant with you,</span>
<span class="verse Gen_26_29" data-osis="Gen.26.29"><span class="verse-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span>that you will do us no harm, as we have not touched you, and as we have done to you nothing but good, and have sent you away in peace.&rsquo; You are now the blessed of Yahweh.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse Gen_26_30" data-osis="Gen.26.30"><span class="verse-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span>He made them a feast, and they ate and drank.</span>
<span class="verse Gen_26_31" data-osis="Gen.26.31"><span class="verse-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span>They rose up some time in the morning, and swore one to another. Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in peace.</span>
<span class="verse Gen_26_32" data-osis="Gen.26.32"><span class="verse-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span>It happened the same day, that Isaac&rsquo;s servants came, and told him concerning the well which they had dug, and said to him, &ldquo;We have found water.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Gen_26_33" data-osis="Gen.26.33"><span class="verse-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span>He called it Shibah.<span class="note">+<dfn>Shibah means &ldquo;oath&rdquo; or &ldquo;seven.&rdquo;</dfn></span> Therefore the name of the city is Beersheba<span class="note">+<dfn>Beersheba means &ldquo;well of the oath&rdquo; or &ldquo;well of the seven&rdquo;</dfn></span> to this day.</span>

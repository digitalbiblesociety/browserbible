<span class="verse" data-osis="Gen.3.22"><span class="verse-num">22&nbsp;</span>Yahweh God said, &ldquo;Behold, the man has become like one of us, knowing good and evil. Now, lest he reach out his hand, and also take of the tree of life, and eat, and live forever...&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Gen.3.23"><span class="verse-num">23&nbsp;</span>Therefore Yahweh God sent him out from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from which he was taken.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Gen.3.24"><span class="verse-num">24&nbsp;</span>So he drove out the man; and he placed cherubim/f + cherubim are powerful angelic creatures, messengers of God with wings. See Ezekiel 10./f* at the east of the garden of Eden, and the flame of a sword which turned every way, to guard the way to the tree of life.</span>

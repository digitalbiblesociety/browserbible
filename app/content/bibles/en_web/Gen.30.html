<span class="verse Gen_30_36" data-osis="Gen.30.36"><span class="verse-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span>He set three days&rsquo; journey between himself and Jacob, and Jacob fed the rest of Laban&rsquo;s flocks.</span>

<span class="verse Gen_30_41" data-osis="Gen.30.41"><span class="verse-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span>It happened, whenever the stronger of the flock conceived, that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the flock in the gutters, that they might conceive among the rods;</span>
<span class="verse Gen_30_42" data-osis="Gen.30.42"><span class="verse-num v-42">42&nbsp;</span>but when the flock were feeble, he didn&rsquo;t put them in. So the feebler were Laban&rsquo;s, and the stronger Jacob&rsquo;s.</span>
<span class="verse Gen_30_43" data-osis="Gen.30.43"><span class="verse-num v-43">43&nbsp;</span>The man increased exceedingly, and had large flocks, female servants and male servants, and camels and donkeys.</span>

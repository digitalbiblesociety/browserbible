<span class="verse Gen_39_2" data-osis="Gen.39.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>Yahweh was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man. He was in the house of his master the Egyptian.</span>
<span class="verse Gen_39_3" data-osis="Gen.39.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>His master saw that Yahweh was with him, and that Yahweh made all that he did prosper in his hand.</span>
<span class="verse Gen_39_4" data-osis="Gen.39.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>Joseph found favor in his sight. He ministered to him, and he made him overseer over his house, and all that he had he put into his hand.</span>
<span class="verse Gen_39_5" data-osis="Gen.39.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>It happened from the time that he made him overseer in his house, and over all that he had, that Yahweh blessed the Egyptian&rsquo;s house for Joseph&rsquo;s sake; and the blessing of Yahweh was on all that he had, in the house and in the field.</span>
<span class="verse Gen_39_6" data-osis="Gen.39.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>He left all that he had in Joseph&rsquo;s hand. He didn&rsquo;t concern himself with anything, except for the food which he ate.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Gen_39_7" data-osis="Gen.39.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>It happened after these things, that his master&rsquo;s wife cast her eyes on Joseph; and she said, &ldquo;Lie with me.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse Gen_39_9" data-osis="Gen.39.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>He isn&rsquo;t greater in this house than I, neither has he kept back anything from me but you, because you are his wife. How then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Gen.50.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>Joseph fell on his father&rsquo;s face, wept on him, and kissed him.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Gen.50.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>Joseph commanded his servants, the physicians, to embalm his father; and the physicians embalmed Israel.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Gen.50.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>Forty days were fulfilled for him, for that is how many the days it takes to embalm. The Egyptians wept for him for seventy days.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Gen.50.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>When the days of weeping for him were past, Joseph spoke to the house of Pharaoh, saying, &ldquo;If now I have found favor in your eyes, please speak in the ears of Pharaoh, saying,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Gen.50.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>&lsquo;My father made me swear, saying, &ldquo;Behold, I am dying. Bury me in my grave which I have dug for myself in the land of Canaan.&rdquo; Now therefore, please let me go up and bury my father, and I will come again.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Gen.50.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>Pharaoh said, &ldquo;Go up, and bury your father, just like he made you swear.&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Gen.50.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>Joseph went up to bury his father; and with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, all the elders of the land of Egypt,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Gen.50.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>all the house of Joseph, his brothers, and his father&rsquo;s house. Only their little ones, their flocks, and their herds, they left in the land of Goshen.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Gen.50.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>There went up with him both chariots and horsemen. It was a very great company.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Gen.50.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>They came to the threshing floor of Atad, which is beyond the Jordan, and there they lamented with a very great and severe lamentation. He mourned for his father seven days.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Gen.50.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>When the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning in the floor of Atad, they said, &ldquo;This is a grievous mourning by the Egyptians.&rdquo; Therefore its name was called Abel Mizraim, which is beyond the Jordan.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Gen.50.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>His sons did to him just as he commanded them,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Gen.50.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>for his sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham bought with the field, for a possession of a burial site, from Ephron the Hittite, before Mamre.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Gen.50.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>Joseph returned into Egypt&mdash;he, and his brothers, and all that went up with him to bury his father, after he had buried his father.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Gen.50.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>When Joseph&rsquo;s brothers saw that their father was dead, they said, &ldquo;It may be that Joseph will hate us, and will fully pay us back for all of the evil which we did to him.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Gen.50.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span>They sent a message to Joseph, saying, &ldquo;Your father commanded before he died, saying,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Gen.50.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span>&lsquo;You shall tell Joseph, &ldquo;Now please forgive the disobedience of your brothers, and their sin, because they did evil to you.&rdquo;&rsquo; Now, please forgive the disobedience of the servants of the God of your father.&rdquo; Joseph wept when they spoke to him.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Gen.50.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span>His brothers also went and fell down before his face; and they said, &ldquo;Behold, we are your servants.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Gen.50.19"><span class="verse-num">19&nbsp;</span>Joseph said to them, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid, for am I in the place of God?</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Gen.50.20"><span class="verse-num">20&nbsp;</span>As for you, you meant evil against me, but God meant it for good, to bring to pass, as it is this day, to save many people alive.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Gen.50.21"><span class="verse-num">21&nbsp;</span>Now therefore don&rsquo;t be afraid. I will nourish you and your little ones.&rdquo; He comforted them, and spoke kindly to them.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Gen.50.22"><span class="verse-num">22&nbsp;</span>Joseph lived in Egypt, he, and his father&rsquo;s house. Joseph lived one hundred ten years.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Gen.50.23"><span class="verse-num">23&nbsp;</span>Joseph saw Ephraim&rsquo;s children to the third generation. The children also of Machir, the son of Manasseh, were born on Joseph&rsquo;s knees.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Gen.50.24"><span class="verse-num">24&nbsp;</span>Joseph said to his brothers, &ldquo;I am dying, but God will surely visit you, and bring you up out of this land to the land which he swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Gen.50.25"><span class="verse-num">25&nbsp;</span>Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel, saying, &ldquo;God will surely visit you, and you shall carry up my bones from here.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse Hab_2_1" data-osis="Hab.2.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>I will stand at my watch, and set myself on the ramparts, and will look out to see what he will say to me, and what I will answer concerning my complaint.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Hab_2_2" data-osis="Hab.2.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>Yahweh answered me, &ldquo;Write the vision, and make it plain on tablets, that he who runs may read it.</span>
<span class="verse Hab_2_3" data-osis="Hab.2.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>For the vision is yet for the appointed time, and it hurries toward the end, and won&rsquo;t prove false. Though it takes time, wait for it; because it will surely come. It won&rsquo;t delay.</span>
<span class="verse Hab_2_4" data-osis="Hab.2.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>Behold, his soul is puffed up. It is not upright in him, but the righteous will live by his faith.</span>
<span class="verse Hab_2_5" data-osis="Hab.2.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>Yes, moreover, wine is treacherous. A haughty man who doesn&rsquo;t stay at home, who enlarges his desire as Sheol<span class="note"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">Sheol is the place of the dead.</span></span> , and he is like death, and can&rsquo;t be satisfied, but gathers to himself all nations, and heaps to himself all peoples.</span>
<span class="verse Hab_2_6" data-osis="Hab.2.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>Won&rsquo;t all these take up a parable against him, and a taunting proverb against him, and say, &lsquo;Woe to him who increases that which is not his, and who enriches himself by extortion! How long?&rsquo;</span>
<span class="verse Hab_2_7" data-osis="Hab.2.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>Won&rsquo;t your debtors rise up suddenly, and wake up those who make you tremble, and you will be their victim?</span>
<span class="verse Hab_2_8" data-osis="Hab.2.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>Because you have plundered many nations, all the remnant of the peoples will plunder you, because of men&rsquo;s blood, and for the violence done to the land, to the city and to all who dwell in it.</span>
<span class="verse Hab_2_9" data-osis="Hab.2.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>Woe to him who gets an evil gain for his house, that he may set his nest on high, that he may be delivered from the hand of evil!</span>
<span class="verse Hab_2_10" data-osis="Hab.2.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>You have devised shame to your house, by cutting off many peoples, and have sinned against your soul.</span>
<span class="verse Hab_2_11" data-osis="Hab.2.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>For the stone will cry out of the wall, and the beam out of the woodwork will answer it.</span>
<span class="verse Hab_2_12" data-osis="Hab.2.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>Woe to him who builds a town with blood, and establishes a city by iniquity!</span>
<span class="verse Hab_2_13" data-osis="Hab.2.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>Behold, isn&rsquo;t it of Yahweh of Armies that the peoples labor for the fire, and the nations weary themselves for vanity?</span>
<span class="verse Hab_2_14" data-osis="Hab.2.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>For the earth will be filled with the knowledge of Yahweh&rsquo;s glory, as the waters cover the sea.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Hab_2_15" data-osis="Hab.2.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Woe to him who gives his neighbor drink, pouring your inflaming wine until they are drunk, so that you may gaze at their naked bodies!</span>
<span class="verse Hab_2_16" data-osis="Hab.2.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>You are filled with shame, and not glory. You will also drink, and be exposed! The cup of Yahweh&rsquo;s right hand will come around to you, and disgrace will cover your glory.</span>
<span class="verse Hab_2_17" data-osis="Hab.2.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>For the violence done to Lebanon will overwhelm you, and the destruction of the animals, which made them afraid; because of men&rsquo;s blood, and for the violence done to the land, to every city and to those who dwell in them.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Hab_2_18" data-osis="Hab.2.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;What value does the engraved image have, that its maker has engraved it; the molten image, even the teacher of lies, that he who fashions its form trusts in it, to make mute idols?</span>
<span class="verse Hab_2_19" data-osis="Hab.2.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>Woe to him who says to the wood, &lsquo;Awake!&rsquo; or to the mute stone, &lsquo;Arise!&rsquo; Shall this teach? Behold, it is overlaid with gold and silver, and there is no breath at all in its midst.</span>
<span class="verse Hab_2_20" data-osis="Hab.2.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>But Yahweh is in his holy temple. Let all the earth be silent before him!&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse Hag_2_1" data-osis="Hag.2.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>In the seventh month, in the twenty-first day of the month, the Word of Yahweh came by Haggai the prophet, saying,</span>
<span class="verse Hag_2_2" data-osis="Hag.2.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Speak now to Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua, the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and to the remnant of the people, saying,</span>
<span class="verse Hag_2_3" data-osis="Hag.2.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>&lsquo;Who is left among you who saw this house in its former glory? How do you see it now? Isn&rsquo;t it in your eyes as nothing?</span>
<span class="verse Hag_2_4" data-osis="Hag.2.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>Yet now be strong, Zerubbabel,&rsquo; says Yahweh. &lsquo;Be strong, Joshua, son of Jehozadak, the high priest. Be strong, all you people of the land,&rsquo; says Yahweh, &lsquo;and work, for I am with you,&rsquo; says Yahweh of Armies.</span>
<span class="verse Hag_2_5" data-osis="Hag.2.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>This is the word that I covenanted with you when you came out of Egypt, and my Spirit lived among you. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid.&rsquo;</span>
<span class="verse Hag_2_6" data-osis="Hag.2.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>For this is what Yahweh of Armies says: &lsquo;Yet once, it is a little while, and I will shake the heavens, the earth, the sea, and the dry land;</span>
<span class="verse Hag_2_7" data-osis="Hag.2.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>and I will shake all nations. The precious things of all nations will come, and I will fill this house with glory, says Yahweh of Armies.</span>
<span class="verse Hag_2_8" data-osis="Hag.2.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>The silver is mine, and the gold is mine,&rsquo; says Yahweh of Armies.</span>
<span class="verse Hag_2_9" data-osis="Hag.2.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>&lsquo;The latter glory of this house will be greater than the former,&rsquo; says Yahweh of Armies; &lsquo;and in this place will I give peace,&rsquo; says Yahweh of Armies.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse Hag_2_10" data-osis="Hag.2.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>In the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month, in the second year of Darius, the Word of Yahweh came by Haggai the prophet, saying,</span>
<span class="verse Hag_2_11" data-osis="Hag.2.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Thus says Yahweh of Armies: Ask now the priests concerning the law, saying,</span>
<span class="verse Hag_2_12" data-osis="Hag.2.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>&lsquo;If someone carries holy meat in the fold of his garment, and with his fold touches bread, stew, wine, oil, or any food, will it become holy?&rsquo;&rdquo;<br>The priests answered, “No.”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Hag_2_13" data-osis="Hag.2.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>Then Haggai said, &ldquo;If one who is unclean by reason of a dead body touch any of these, will it be unclean?&rdquo;<br>The priests answered, “It will be unclean.”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Hag_2_14" data-osis="Hag.2.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>Then Haggai answered, &ldquo;&lsquo;So is this people, and so is this nation before me,&rsquo; says Yahweh; &lsquo;and so is every work of their hands. That which they offer there is unclean.</span>
<span class="verse Hag_2_15" data-osis="Hag.2.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>Now, please consider from this day and backward, before a stone was laid on a stone in Yahweh&rsquo;s temple.</span>
<span class="verse Hag_2_16" data-osis="Hag.2.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>Through all that time, when one came to a heap of twenty measures, there were only ten. When one came to the wine vat to draw out fifty, there were only twenty.</span>
<span class="verse Hag_2_17" data-osis="Hag.2.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>I struck you with blight, mildew, and hail in all the work of your hands; yet you didn&rsquo;t turn to me,&rsquo; says Yahweh.</span>
<span class="verse Hag_2_18" data-osis="Hag.2.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>&lsquo;Consider, please, from this day and backward, from the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month, since the day that the foundation of Yahweh&rsquo;s temple was laid, consider it.</span>
<span class="verse Hag_2_19" data-osis="Hag.2.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>Is the seed yet in the barn? Yes, the vine, the fig tree, the pomegranate, and the olive tree haven&rsquo;t produced. From this day will I bless you.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Hag_2_20" data-osis="Hag.2.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>The Word of Yahweh came the second time to Haggai in the twenty-fourth day of the month, saying,</span>
<span class="verse Hag_2_21" data-osis="Hag.2.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Speak to Zerubbabel, governor of Judah, saying, &lsquo;I will shake the heavens and the earth.</span>
<span class="verse Hag_2_22" data-osis="Hag.2.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>I will overthrow the throne of kingdoms. I will destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the nations. I will overthrow the chariots, and those who ride in them. The horses and their riders will come down, everyone by the sword of his brother.</span>
<span class="verse Hag_2_23" data-osis="Hag.2.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>In that day, says Yahweh of Armies, will I take you, Zerubbabel, my servant, the son of Shealtiel,&rsquo; says Yahweh, &lsquo;and will make you as a signet, for I have chosen you,&rsquo; says Yahweh of Armies.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Hag.3.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>Woe to her who is rebellious and polluted, the oppressing city!</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Hag.3.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>She didn&rsquo;t obey the voice. She didn&rsquo;t receive correction. She didn&rsquo;t trust in Yahweh. She didn&rsquo;t draw near to her God.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Hag.3.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>Her princes in the midst of her are roaring lions. Her judges are evening wolves. They leave nothing until the next day.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Hag.3.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>Her prophets are arrogant and treacherous people. Her priests have profaned the sanctuary. They have done violence to the law.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Hag.3.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>Yahweh, in the midst of her, is righteous. He will do no wrong. Every morning he brings his justice to light. He doesn&rsquo;t fail, but the unjust know no shame.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Hag.3.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>I have cut off nations. Their battlements are desolate. I have made their streets waste, so that no one passes by. Their cities are destroyed, so that there is no man, so that there is no inhabitant.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Hag.3.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>I said, &ldquo;Just fear me. Receive correction, so that her dwelling won&rsquo;t be cut off, according to all that I have appointed concerning her.&rdquo; But they rose early and corrupted all their doings.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Hag.3.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Therefore wait for me,&rdquo; says Yahweh, &ldquo;until the day that I rise up to the prey, for my determination is to gather the nations, that I may assemble the kingdoms, to pour on them my indignation, even all my fierce anger, for all the earth will be devoured with the fire of my jealousy.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Hag.3.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>For then I will purify the lips of the peoples, that they may all call on Yahweh&rsquo;s name, to serve him shoulder to shoulder.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Hag.3.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>From beyond the rivers of Cush, my worshipers, even the daughter of my dispersed people, will bring my offering.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Hag.3.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>In that day you will not be disappointed for all your doings, in which you have transgressed against me; for then I will take away out of your midst your proudly exulting ones, and you will no more be haughty in my holy mountain.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Hag.3.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>But I will leave in your midst an afflicted and poor people, and they will take refuge in Yahweh&rsquo;s name.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Hag.3.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>The remnant of Israel will not do iniquity, nor speak lies, neither will a deceitful tongue be found in their mouth, for they will feed and lie down, and no one will make them afraid.&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Hag.3.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>Sing, daughter of Zion! Shout, Israel! Be glad and rejoice with all your heart, daughter of Jerusalem.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Hag.3.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>Yahweh has taken away your judgments. He has thrown out your enemy. The King of Israel, Yahweh, is in your midst. You will not be afraid of evil any more.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Hag.3.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span>In that day, it will be said to Jerusalem, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid, Zion. Don&rsquo;t let your hands be weak.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Hag.3.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span>Yahweh, your God, is in your midst, a mighty one who will save. He will rejoice over you with joy. He will calm you in his love. He will rejoice over you with singing.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Hag.3.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span>I will remove those who grieve about the appointed feasts from you. They are a burden and a reproach to you.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Hag.3.19"><span class="verse-num">19&nbsp;</span>Behold,<span class="note"> <dfn>+ &ldquo;Behold,&rdquo; from &ldquo;הִנֵּה&rdquo;, means look at, take notice, observe, see, or gaze at. It is often used as an interjection.</dfn></span> at that time I will deal with all those who afflict you, and I will save those who are lame, and gather those who were driven away. I will give them praise and honor, whose shame has been in all the earth.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Hag.3.20"><span class="verse-num">20&nbsp;</span>At that time will I bring you in, and at that time will I gather you; for I will give you honor and praise among all the peoples of the earth, when I restore your fortunes before your eyes, says Yahweh.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Heb.3.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>Therefore, holy brothers, partakers of a heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our confession, Jesus;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Heb.3.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>who was faithful to him who appointed him, as also was Moses in all his house.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Heb.3.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>For he has been counted worthy of more glory than Moses, because he who built the house has more honor than the house.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Heb.3.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>For every house is built by someone; but he who built all things is God.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Heb.3.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>Moses indeed was faithful in all his house as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were afterward to be spoken,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Heb.3.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>but Christ is faithful as a Son over his house; whose house we are, if we hold fast our confidence and the glorying of our hope firm to the end.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Heb.3.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>Therefore, even as the Holy Spirit says,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Heb.3.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>don&rsquo;t harden your hearts, as in the rebellion,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Heb.3.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>where your fathers tested me by proving me,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Heb.3.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>Therefore I was displeased with that generation,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Heb.3.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>as I swore in my wrath,</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Heb.3.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>Beware, brothers, lest perhaps there be in any one of you an evil heart of unbelief, in falling away from the living God;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Heb.3.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>but exhort one another day by day, so long as it is called &ldquo;today&rdquo;; lest any one of you be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Heb.3.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>For we have become partakers of Christ, if we hold fast the beginning of our confidence firm to the end:</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Heb.3.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>while it is said,</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Heb.3.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span>For who, when they heard, rebelled? No, didn&rsquo;t all those who came out of Egypt by Moses?</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Heb.3.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span>With whom was he displeased forty years? Wasn&rsquo;t it with those who sinned, whose bodies fell in the wilderness?</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Heb.3.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span>To whom did he swear that they wouldn&rsquo;t enter into his rest, but to those who were disobedient?</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Heb.3.19"><span class="verse-num">19&nbsp;</span>We see that they were not able to enter in because of unbelief.</span>

<span class="verse Heb_5_1" data-osis="Heb.5.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>For every high priest, being taken from among men, is appointed for men in things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins.</span>
<span class="verse Heb_5_2" data-osis="Heb.5.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>The high priest can deal gently with those who are ignorant and going astray, because he himself is also surrounded with weakness.</span>
<span class="verse Heb_5_3" data-osis="Heb.5.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>Because of this, he must offer sacrifices for sins for the people, as well as for himself.</span>
<span class="verse Heb_5_4" data-osis="Heb.5.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>Nobody takes this honor on himself, but he is called by God, just like Aaron was.</span>
<span class="verse Heb_5_5" data-osis="Heb.5.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>So also Christ didn&rsquo;t glorify himself to be made a high priest, but it was he who said to him,<br /> &ldquo;You are my Son.<br /> Today I have become your father.&rdquo;<span class="cf"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">Psalm 2:7</span></span> </span>

<p>
<span class="verse Heb_5_6" data-osis="Heb.5.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>As he says also in another place,<br /> &ldquo;You are a priest forever,<br /> after the order of Melchizedek.&rdquo;<span class="cf"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">Psalm 110:4</span></span> </span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Heb_5_7" data-osis="Heb.5.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>He, in the days of his flesh, having offered up prayers and petitions with strong crying and tears to him who was able to save him from death, and having been heard for his godly fear,</span>
<span class="verse Heb_5_8" data-osis="Heb.5.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>though he was a Son, yet learned obedience by the things which he suffered.</span>
<span class="verse Heb_5_9" data-osis="Heb.5.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>Having been made perfect, he became to all of those who obey him the author of eternal salvation,</span>
<span class="verse Heb_5_10" data-osis="Heb.5.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>named by God a high priest after the order of Melchizedek.</span>
<span class="verse Heb_5_11" data-osis="Heb.5.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>About him we have many words to say, and hard to interpret, seeing you have become dull of hearing.</span>
<span class="verse Heb_5_12" data-osis="Heb.5.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>For although by this time you should be teachers, you again need to have someone teach you the rudiments of the first principles of the oracles of God. You have come to need milk, and not solid food.</span>
<span class="verse Heb_5_13" data-osis="Heb.5.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>For everyone who lives on milk is not experienced in the word of righteousness, for he is a baby.</span>
<span class="verse Heb_5_14" data-osis="Heb.5.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>But solid food is for those who are full grown, who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern good and evil.</span>

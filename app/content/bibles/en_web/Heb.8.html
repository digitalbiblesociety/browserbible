<span class="verse Heb_8_1" data-osis="Heb.8.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>Now in the things which we are saying, the main point is this. We have such a high priest, who sat down on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens,</span>
<span class="verse Heb_8_2" data-osis="Heb.8.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>a servant of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, not man.</span>
<span class="verse Heb_8_3" data-osis="Heb.8.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>For every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices. Therefore it is necessary that this high priest also have something to offer.</span>
<span class="verse Heb_8_4" data-osis="Heb.8.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>For if he were on earth, he would not be a priest at all, seeing there are priests who offer the gifts according to the law;</span>
<span class="verse Heb_8_5" data-osis="Heb.8.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>who serve a copy and shadow of the heavenly things, even as Moses was warned by God when he was about to make the tabernacle, for he said, &ldquo;See, you shall make everything according to the pattern that was shown to you on the mountain.&rdquo;<span class="cf"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">Exodus 25:40</span></span> </span>
<span class="verse Heb_8_6" data-osis="Heb.8.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>But now he has obtained a more excellent ministry, by so much as he is also the mediator of a better covenant, which on better promises has been given as law.</span>
<span class="verse Heb_8_7" data-osis="Heb.8.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>For if that first covenant had been faultless, then no place would have been sought for a second.</span>
<span class="verse Heb_8_8" data-osis="Heb.8.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>For finding fault with them, he said,<br /> &ldquo;Behold,<span class="note"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">&ldquo;Behold,&rdquo; from &ldquo;ἰδοὺ,&rdquo; means look at, take notice, observe, see, or gaze at. It is often used as an interjection.</span></span>  the days come,&rdquo; says the Lord,<br /> &ldquo;that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah;<br /></span>
<span class="verse Heb_8_9" data-osis="Heb.8.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers,<br /> in the day that I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt;<br /> for they didn&rsquo;t continue in my covenant,<br /> and I disregarded them,&rdquo; says the Lord.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Heb_8_10" data-osis="Heb.8.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel.<br /> After those days,&rdquo; says the Lord;<br /> &ldquo;I will put my laws into their mind,<br /> I will also write them on their heart.<br /> I will be their God,<br /> and they will be my people.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Heb_8_11" data-osis="Heb.8.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>They will not teach every man his fellow citizen,<span class="note"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">TR reads &ldquo;neighbor&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;fellow citizen&rdquo;</span></span> <br /> and every man his brother, saying, &lsquo;Know the Lord,&rsquo;<br /> for all will know me,<br /> from their least to their greatest.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Heb_8_12" data-osis="Heb.8.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness.<br /> I will remember their sins and lawless deeds no more.&rdquo;<span class="cf"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">Jeremiah 31:31-34</span></span> </span>

<span class="verse Heb_8_13" data-osis="Heb.8.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>In that he says, &ldquo;A new covenant,&rdquo; he has made the first old. But that which is becoming old and grows aged is near to vanishing away.</span>

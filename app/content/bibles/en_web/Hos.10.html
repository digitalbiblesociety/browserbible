<span class="verse Hos_10_1" data-osis="Hos.10.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>Israel is a luxuriant vine that produces his fruit.<br /> According to the abundance of his fruit he has multiplied his altars.<br /> As their land has prospered, they have adorned their sacred stones.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Hos_10_2" data-osis="Hos.10.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>Their heart is divided.<br /> Now they will be found guilty.<br /> He will demolish their altars.<br /> He will destroy their sacred stones.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Hos_10_3" data-osis="Hos.10.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>Surely now they will say, &ldquo;We have no king; for we don&rsquo;t fear Yahweh;<br /> and the king, what can he do for us?&rdquo;<br /></span>
<span class="verse Hos_10_4" data-osis="Hos.10.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>They make promises, swearing falsely in making covenants.<br /> Therefore judgment springs up like poisonous weeds in the furrows of the field.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Hos_10_5" data-osis="Hos.10.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>The inhabitants of Samaria will be in terror for the calves of Beth Aven;<br /> for its people will mourn over it,<br /> Along with its priests who rejoiced over it,<br /> for its glory, because it has departed from it.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Hos_10_6" data-osis="Hos.10.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>It also will be carried to Assyria for a present to a great king.<br /> Ephraim will receive shame,<br /> and Israel will be ashamed of his own counsel.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Hos_10_7" data-osis="Hos.10.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>Samaria and her king float away,<br /> like a twig on the water.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Hos_10_8" data-osis="Hos.10.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>The high places also of Aven, the sin of Israel, will be destroyed.<br /> The thorn and the thistle will come up on their altars.<br /> They will tell the mountains, &ldquo;Cover us!&rdquo; and the hills, &ldquo;Fall on us!&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse Hos_10_9" data-osis="Hos.10.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Israel, you have sinned from the days of Gibeah.<br /> There they remained.<br /> The battle against the children of iniquity doesn&rsquo;t overtake them in Gibeah.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Hos_10_10" data-osis="Hos.10.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>When it is my desire, I will chastise them;<br /> and the nations will be gathered against them,<br /> when they are bound to their two transgressions.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Hos_10_11" data-osis="Hos.10.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>Ephraim is a trained heifer that loves to thresh;<br /> so I will put a yoke on her beautiful neck.<br /> I will set a rider on Ephraim.<br /> Judah will plow.<br /> Jacob will break his clods.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Hos_10_12" data-osis="Hos.10.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>Sow to yourselves in righteousness,<br /> reap according to kindness.<br /> Break up your fallow ground;<br /> for it is time to seek Yahweh,<br /> until he comes and rains righteousness on you.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Hos_10_13" data-osis="Hos.10.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>You have plowed wickedness.<br /> You have reaped iniquity.<br /> You have eaten the fruit of lies,<br /> for you trusted in your way, in the multitude of your mighty men.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Hos_10_14" data-osis="Hos.10.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>Therefore a battle roar will arise among your people,<br /> and all your fortresses will be destroyed,<br /> as Shalman destroyed Beth Arbel in the day of battle.<br /> The mother was dashed in pieces with her children.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Hos_10_15" data-osis="Hos.10.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>So Bethel will do to you because of your great wickedness.<br /> At daybreak the king of Israel will be destroyed.</span>

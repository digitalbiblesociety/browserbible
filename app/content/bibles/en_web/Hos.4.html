<br /><br />
<span class="verse Hos_4_4" data-osis="Hos.4.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Yet let no man bring a charge, neither let any man accuse; For your people are like those who bring charges against a priest.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Hos_4_5" data-osis="Hos.4.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>You will stumble in the day,<br /> and the prophet will also stumble with you in the night;<br /> and I will destroy your mother.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Hos_4_6" data-osis="Hos.4.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge.<br /> Because you have rejected knowledge, I will also reject you,<br /> that you may be no priest to me.<br /> Because you have forgotten your God&rsquo;s law,<br /> I will also forget your children.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Hos_4_7" data-osis="Hos.4.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>As they were multiplied, so they sinned against me.<br /> I will change their glory into shame.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Hos_4_8" data-osis="Hos.4.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>They feed on the sin of my people,<br /> and set their heart on their iniquity.<br /></span>

<span class="verse Hos_4_11" data-osis="Hos.4.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>Prostitution, wine, and new wine take away understanding.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Hos_4_12" data-osis="Hos.4.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>My people consult with their wooden idol,<br /> and answer to a stick of wood.<br /> Indeed the spirit of prostitution has led them astray,<br /> and they have been unfaithful to their God.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Hos_4_13" data-osis="Hos.4.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>They sacrifice on the tops of the mountains,<br /> and burn incense on the hills, under oaks and poplars and terebinths,<br /> because its shade is good.<br /> Therefore your daughters play the prostitute,<br /> and your brides commit adultery.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Hos_4_14" data-osis="Hos.4.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>I will not punish your daughters when they play the prostitute,<br /> nor your brides when they commit adultery;<br /> because the men consort with prostitutes,<br /> and they sacrifice with the shrine prostitutes;<br /> so the people without understanding will come to ruin.</span>

<span class="verse Hos_4_16" data-osis="Hos.4.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>For Israel has behaved extremely stubbornly, like a stubborn heifer.<br /> Then how will Yahweh feed them like a lamb in a meadow.<br /></span>

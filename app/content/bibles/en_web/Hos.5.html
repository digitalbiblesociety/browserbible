<span class="verse Hos_5_4" data-osis="Hos.5.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>Their deeds won&rsquo;t allow them to turn to their God;<br /> for the spirit of prostitution is within them,<br /> and they don&rsquo;t know Yahweh.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Hos_5_5" data-osis="Hos.5.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>The pride of Israel testifies to his face.<br /> Therefore Israel and Ephraim will stumble in their iniquity.<br /> Judah also will stumble with them.<br /></span>

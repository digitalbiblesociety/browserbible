<span class="verse Hos_8_2" data-osis="Hos.8.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>They cry to me, &lsquo;My God, we Israel acknowledge you!&rsquo;<br /></span>
<span class="verse Hos_8_3" data-osis="Hos.8.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>Israel has cast off that which is good.<br /> The enemy will pursue him.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Hos_8_4" data-osis="Hos.8.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>They have set up kings, but not by me.<br /> They have made princes, and I didn&rsquo;t approve.<br /> Of their silver and their gold they have made themselves idols,<br /> that they may be cut off.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Hos_8_5" data-osis="Hos.8.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>Let Samaria throw out his calf idol!<br /> My anger burns against them!<br /> How long will it be until they are capable of purity?<br /></span>
<span class="verse Hos_8_6" data-osis="Hos.8.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>For this is even from Israel!<br /> The workman made it, and it is no God;<br /> indeed, the calf of Samaria shall be broken in pieces.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Hos_8_7" data-osis="Hos.8.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>For they sow the wind,<br /> and they will reap the whirlwind.<br /> He has no standing grain.<br /> The stalk will yield no head.<br /> If it does yield, strangers will swallow it up.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Hos_8_8" data-osis="Hos.8.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>Israel is swallowed up.<br /> Now they are among the nations like a worthless thing.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Hos_8_9" data-osis="Hos.8.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>For they have gone up to Assyria,<br /> like a wild donkey wandering alone.<br /> Ephraim has hired lovers for himself.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Hos_8_10" data-osis="Hos.8.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>But although they sold themselves among the nations,<br /> I will now gather them;<br /> and they begin to waste away because of the oppression of the king of mighty ones.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Hos_8_11" data-osis="Hos.8.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>Because Ephraim has multiplied altars for sinning,<br /> they became for him altars for sinning.<br /></span>

<span class="verse Hos_8_14" data-osis="Hos.8.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>For Israel has forgotten his Maker and built palaces;<br /> and Judah has multiplied fortified cities;<br /> but I will send a fire on his cities,<br /> and it will devour its fortresses.&rdquo;</span>

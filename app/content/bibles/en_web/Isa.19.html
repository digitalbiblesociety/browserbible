<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.19.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>The burden of Egypt: &ldquo;Behold, Yahweh rides on a swift cloud, and comes to Egypt. The idols of Egypt will tremble at his presence; and the heart of Egypt will melt in its midst.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.19.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>I will stir up the Egyptians against the Egyptians, and they will fight everyone against his brother, and everyone against his neighbor; city against city, and kingdom against kingdom.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.19.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>The spirit of Egypt will fail in its midst. I will destroy its counsel. They will seek the idols, the charmers, those who have familiar spirits, and the wizards.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.19.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>I will give over the Egyptians into the hand of a cruel lord. A fierce king will rule over them,&rdquo; says the Lord, Yahweh of Armies.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.19.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>The waters will fail from the sea, and the river will be wasted and become dry.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.19.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>The rivers will become foul. The streams of Egypt will be diminished and dried up. The reeds and flags will wither away.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.19.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>The meadows by the Nile, by the brink of the Nile, and all the sown fields of the Nile, will become dry, be driven away, and be no more.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.19.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>The fishermen will lament, and all those who fish in the Nile will mourn, and those who spread nets on the waters will languish.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.19.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>Moreover those who work in combed flax, and those who weave white cloth, will be confounded.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.19.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>The pillars will be broken in pieces. All those who work for hire will be grieved in soul.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.19.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>The princes of Zoan are utterly foolish. The counsel of the wisest counselors of Pharaoh has become stupid. How do you say to Pharaoh, &ldquo;I am the son of the wise, the son of ancient kings?&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.19.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>Where then are your wise men? Let them tell you now; and let them know what Yahweh of Armies has purposed concerning Egypt.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.19.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>The princes of Zoan have become fools. The princes of Memphis are deceived. They have caused Egypt to go astray, who are the cornerstone of her tribes.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.19.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>Yahweh has mixed a spirit of perverseness in the midst of her; and they have caused Egypt to go astray in all of its works, like a drunken man staggers in his vomit.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.19.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>Neither shall there be any work for Egypt, which head or tail, palm branch or rush, may do.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.19.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span>In that day the Egyptians will be like women. They will tremble and fear because of the shaking of the hand of Yahweh of Armies, which he shakes over them.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.19.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span>The land of Judah will become a terror to Egypt. Everyone to whom mention is made of it will be afraid, because of the plans of Yahweh of Armies, which he determines against it.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.19.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span>In that day, there will be five cities in the land of Egypt that speak the language of Canaan, and swear to Yahweh of Armies. One will be called &ldquo;The city of destruction.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.19.19"><span class="verse-num">19&nbsp;</span>In that day, there will be an altar to Yahweh in the midst of the land of Egypt, and a pillar to Yahweh at its border.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.19.20"><span class="verse-num">20&nbsp;</span>It will be for a sign and for a witness to Yahweh of Armies in the land of Egypt; for they will cry to Yahweh because of oppressors, and he will send them a savior and a defender, and he will deliver them.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.19.21"><span class="verse-num">21&nbsp;</span>Yahweh will be known to Egypt, and the Egyptians will know Yahweh in that day. Yes, they will worship with sacrifice and offering, and will vow a vow to Yahweh, and will perform it.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.19.22"><span class="verse-num">22&nbsp;</span>Yahweh will strike Egypt, striking and healing. They will return to Yahweh, and he will be entreated by them, and will heal them.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.19.23"><span class="verse-num">23&nbsp;</span>In that day there will be a highway out of Egypt to Assyria, and the Assyrian shall come into Egypt, and the Egyptian into Assyria; and the Egyptians will worship with the Assyrians.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.19.24"><span class="verse-num">24&nbsp;</span>In that day, Israel will be the third with Egypt and with Assyria, a blessing in the midst of the earth;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.19.25"><span class="verse-num">25&nbsp;</span>because Yahweh of Armies has blessed them, saying, &ldquo;Blessed be Egypt my people, Assyria the work of my hands, and Israel my inheritance.&rdquo;</span>

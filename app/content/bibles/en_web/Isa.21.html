<span class="verse Isa_21_1" data-osis="Isa.21.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>The burden of the wilderness of the sea. As whirlwinds in the South sweep through, it comes from the wilderness, from an awesome land.</span>
<span class="verse Isa_21_2" data-osis="Isa.21.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>A grievous vision is declared to me. The treacherous man deals treacherously, and the destroyer destroys. Go up, Elam; attack! I have stopped all of Media&rsquo;s sighing.</span>
<span class="verse Isa_21_3" data-osis="Isa.21.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>Therefore my thighs are filled with anguish. Pains have taken hold on me, like the pains of a woman in labor. I am in so much pain that I can&rsquo;t hear. I so am dismayed that I can&rsquo;t see.</span>
<span class="verse Isa_21_4" data-osis="Isa.21.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>My heart flutters. Horror has frightened me. The twilight that I desired has been turned into trembling for me.</span>
<span class="verse Isa_21_5" data-osis="Isa.21.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>They prepare the table. They set the watch. They eat. They drink. Rise up, you princes, oil the shield!</span>
<span class="verse Isa_21_6" data-osis="Isa.21.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>For the Lord said to me, &ldquo;Go, set a watchman. Let him declare what he sees.</span>
<span class="verse Isa_21_7" data-osis="Isa.21.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>When he sees a troop, horsemen in pairs, a troop of donkeys, a troop of camels, he shall listen diligently with great attentiveness.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Isa_21_8" data-osis="Isa.21.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>He cried like a lion: &ldquo;Lord, I stand continually on the watchtower in the daytime, and every night I stay at my post.</span>
<span class="verse Isa_21_9" data-osis="Isa.21.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>Behold, here comes a troop of men, horsemen in pairs.&rdquo; He answered, &ldquo;Fallen, fallen is Babylon; and all the engraved images of her gods are broken to the ground.</span>
<span class="verse Isa_21_10" data-osis="Isa.21.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>You are my threshing, and the grain of my floor!&rdquo; That which I have heard from Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, I have declared to you.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Isa_21_11" data-osis="Isa.21.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>The burden of Dumah. One calls to me out of Seir, &ldquo;Watchman, what of the night? Watchman, what of the night?&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Isa_21_12" data-osis="Isa.21.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>The watchman said, &ldquo;The morning comes, and also the night. If you will inquire, inquire. Come back again.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Isa_21_13" data-osis="Isa.21.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>The burden on Arabia. In the forest in Arabia you will lodge, you caravans of Dedanites.</span>
<span class="verse Isa_21_14" data-osis="Isa.21.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>They brought water to him who was thirsty. The inhabitants of the land of Tema met the fugitives with their bread.</span>
<span class="verse Isa_21_15" data-osis="Isa.21.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>For they fled away from the swords, from the drawn sword, from the bent bow, and from the heat of battle.</span>
<span class="verse Isa_21_16" data-osis="Isa.21.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>For the Lord said to me, &ldquo;Within a year, as a worker bound by contract would count it, all the glory of Kedar will fail,</span>
<span class="verse Isa_21_17" data-osis="Isa.21.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>and the residue of the number of the archers, the mighty men of the children of Kedar, will be few; for Yahweh, the God of Israel, has spoken it.&rdquo;</span>

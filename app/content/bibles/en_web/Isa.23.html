<span class="verse Isa_23_8" data-osis="Isa.23.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>Who has planned this against Tyre, the giver of crowns, whose merchants are princes, whose traffickers are the honorable of the earth?</span>
<span class="verse Isa_23_9" data-osis="Isa.23.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>Yahweh of Armies has planned it, to stain the pride of all glory, to bring into contempt all the honorable of the earth.</span>

<span class="verse Isa_23_13" data-osis="Isa.23.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>Behold, the land of the Chaldeans. This people was not. The Assyrians founded it for those who dwell in the wilderness. They set up their towers. They overthrew its palaces. They made it a ruin.</span>

<span class="verse Isa_23_16" data-osis="Isa.23.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>Take a harp; go about the city, you prostitute that has been forgotten. Make sweet melody. Sing many songs, that you may be remembered.</span>

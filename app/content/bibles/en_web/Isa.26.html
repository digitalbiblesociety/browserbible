<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.26.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>In that day, this song will be sung in the land of Judah:</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.26.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>Open the gates, that the righteous nation may enter:</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.26.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>You will keep whoever&rsquo;s mind is steadfast in perfect peace,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.26.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>Trust in Yahweh forever;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.26.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>For he has brought down those who dwell on high, the lofty city.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.26.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>The foot shall tread it down;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.26.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>The way of the just is uprightness.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.26.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>Yes, in the way of your judgments, Yahweh, have we waited for you. Your name and your renown are the desire of our soul.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.26.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>With my soul have I desired you in the night. Yes, with my spirit within me will I seek you earnestly; for when your judgments are in the earth, the inhabitants of the world learn righteousness.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.26.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>Let favor be shown to the wicked, yet he will not learn righteousness. In the land of uprightness he will deal wrongfully, and will not see Yahweh&rsquo;s majesty.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.26.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>Yahweh, your hand is lifted up, yet they don&rsquo;t see; but they will see your zeal for the people, and be disappointed. Yes, fire will consume your adversaries.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.26.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>Yahweh, you will ordain peace for us, for you have also worked all our works for us.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.26.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>Yahweh our God, other lords besides you have had dominion over us, but by you only will we make mention of your name.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.26.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>The dead shall not live. The departed spirits shall not rise. Therefore you have visited and destroyed them, and caused all memory of them to perish.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.26.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>You have increased the nation, O Yahweh. You have increased the nation! You are glorified! You have enlarged all the borders of the land.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.26.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span>Yahweh, in trouble they have visited you. They poured out a prayer when your chastening was on them.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.26.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span>Like as a woman with child, who draws near the time of her delivery, is in pain and cries out in her pangs; so we have been before you, Yahweh.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.26.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span>We have been with child. We have been in pain. We gave birth, it seems, only to wind. We have not worked any deliverance in the earth; neither have the inhabitants of the world fallen.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.26.19"><span class="verse-num">19&nbsp;</span>Your dead shall live. My dead bodies shall arise. Awake and sing, you who dwell in the dust; for your dew is like the dew of herbs, and the earth will cast out the departed spirits.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.26.20"><span class="verse-num">20&nbsp;</span>Come, my people, enter into your rooms, and shut your doors behind you. Hide yourself for a little moment, until the indignation is past.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.26.21"><span class="verse-num">21&nbsp;</span>For, behold, Yahweh comes out of his place to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity. The earth also will disclose her blood, and will no longer cover her slain.</span>

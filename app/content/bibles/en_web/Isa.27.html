<span class="verse Isa_27_2" data-osis="Isa.27.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>In that day, sing to her, &ldquo;A pleasant vineyard!</span>
<span class="verse Isa_27_3" data-osis="Isa.27.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>I, Yahweh, am its keeper. I will water it every moment. Lest anyone damage it, I will keep it night and day.</span>
<span class="verse Isa_27_4" data-osis="Isa.27.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>Wrath is not in me, but if I should find briers and thorns, I would do battle! I would march on them and I would burn them together.</span>

<span class="verse Isa_27_9" data-osis="Isa.27.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>Therefore by this the iniquity of Jacob will be forgiven, and this is all the fruit of taking away his sin: that he makes all the stones of the altar as chalk stones that are beaten in pieces, so that the Asherah poles and the incense altars shall rise no more.</span>
<span class="verse Isa_27_10" data-osis="Isa.27.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>For the fortified city is solitary, a habitation deserted and forsaken, like the wilderness. The calf will feed there, and there he will lie down, and consume its branches.</span>
<span class="verse Isa_27_11" data-osis="Isa.27.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>When its boughs are withered, they will be broken off.

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.27.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>In that day, Yahweh with his hard and great and strong sword will punish leviathan, the fleeing serpent, and leviathan the twisted serpent; and he will kill the dragon that is in the sea.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.27.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>In that day, sing to her, &ldquo;A pleasant vineyard!</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.27.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>I, Yahweh, am its keeper. I will water it every moment. Lest anyone damage it, I will keep it night and day.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.27.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>Wrath is not in me, but if I should find briers and thorns, I would do battle! I would march on them and I would burn them together.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.27.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>Or else let him take hold of my strength, that he may make peace with me. Let him make peace with me.&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.27.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>In days to come, Jacob will take root. Israel will blossom and bud. They will fill the surface of the world with fruit.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.27.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>Has he struck them as he struck those who struck them? Or are they killed like those who killed them were killed?</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.27.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>In measure, when you send them away, you contend with them. He has removed them with his rough blast in the day of the east wind.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.27.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>Therefore by this the iniquity of Jacob will be forgiven, and this is all the fruit of taking away his sin: that he makes all the stones of the altar as chalk stones that are beaten in pieces, so that the Asherah poles and the incense altars shall rise no more.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.27.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>For the fortified city is solitary, a habitation deserted and forsaken, like the wilderness. The calf will feed there, and there he will lie down, and consume its branches.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.27.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>When its boughs are withered, they will be broken off. The women will come and set them on fire, for they are a people of no understanding. Therefore he who made them will not have compassion on them, and he who formed them will show them no favor.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.27.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>It will happen in that day, that Yahweh will thresh from the flowing stream of the Euphrates to the brook of Egypt; and you will be gathered one by one, children of Israel.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.27.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>It will happen in that day that a great trumpet will be blown; and those who were ready to perish in the land of Assyria, and those who were outcasts in the land of Egypt, shall come; and they will worship Yahweh in the holy mountain at Jerusalem.</span>

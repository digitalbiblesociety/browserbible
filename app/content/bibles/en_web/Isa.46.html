<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.46.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>Bel bows down, Nebo stoops; their idols are on the animals, and on the livestock: the things that you carried about are made a load, a burden to the weary.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.46.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>They stoop, they bow down together; they could not deliver the burden, but themselves have gone into captivity.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.46.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Listen to me, house of Jacob, and all the remnant of the house of Israel, that have been borne from their birth, that have been carried from the womb;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.46.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>and even to old age I am he, and even to gray hairs will I carry you. I have made, and I will bear; yes, I will carry, and will deliver.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.46.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;To whom will you liken me, and make me equal, and compare me, that we may be like?</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.46.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>Some pour out gold from the bag, and weigh silver in the balance. They hire a goldsmith, and he makes it a god. They fall down&mdash;yes, they worship.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.46.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>They bear it on the shoulder, they carry it, and set it in its place, and it stands, from its place it shall not move: yes, one may cry to it, yet it can not answer, nor save him out of his trouble.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.46.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Remember this, and show yourselves men; bring it again to mind, you transgressors.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.46.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>Remember the former things of old: for I am God, and there is no one else; I am God, and there is none like me;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.46.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>declaring the end from the beginning, and from ancient times things that are not yet done; saying, My counsel shall stand, and I will do all my pleasure;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.46.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>calling a ravenous bird from the east, the man of my counsel from a far country; yes, I have spoken, I will also bring it to pass; I have purposed, I will also do it.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.46.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>Listen to me, you stout-hearted, who are far from righteousness:</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.46.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>I bring near my righteousness, it shall not be far off, and my salvation shall not wait; and I will place salvation in Zion for Israel my glory.</span>

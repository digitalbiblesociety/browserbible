<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.47.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Come down, and sit in the dust, virgin daughter of Babylon; sit on the ground without a throne, daughter of the Chaldeans: for you shall no more be called tender and delicate.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.47.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>Take the millstones, and grind meal; remove your veil, strip off the train, uncover the leg, pass through the rivers.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.47.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>Your nakedness shall be uncovered, yes, your shame shall be seen: I will take vengeance, and will spare no man.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.47.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>Our Redeemer, Yahweh of Armies is his name, the Holy One of Israel.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.47.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Sit in silence, and go into darkness, daughter of the Chaldeans;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.47.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>I was angry with my people, I profaned my inheritance, and gave them into your hand: you showed them no mercy; on the aged you have very heavily laid your yoke.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.47.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>You said, &lsquo;I shall be a mistress forever;&rsquo; so that you did not lay these things to your heart, nor did you remember the latter end of it.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.47.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Now therefore hear this, you who are given to pleasures, who sit securely, who say in your heart, &lsquo;I am, and there is no one else besides me; I shall not sit as a widow, neither shall I know the loss of children:&rsquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.47.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>but these two things shall come to you in a moment in one day, the loss of children, and widowhood; in their full measure shall they come on you, in the multitude of your sorceries, and the great abundance of your enchantments.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.47.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>For you have trusted in your wickedness; you have said, No one sees me; your wisdom and your knowledge, it has perverted you, and you have said in your heart, I am, and there is no one else besides me.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.47.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>Therefore evil will come on you; you won&rsquo;t know when it dawns: and mischief will fall on you; you will not be able to put it away: and desolation shall come on you suddenly, which you don&rsquo;t know.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.47.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Stand now with your enchantments, and with the multitude of your sorceries, in which you have labored from your youth; if so be you shall be able to profit, if so be you may prevail.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.47.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>You are wearied in the multitude of your counsels: let now the astrologers, the stargazers, the monthly prognosticators, stand up, and save you from the things that shall come on you.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.47.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>Behold, they shall be as stubble; the fire shall burn them; they shall not deliver themselves from the power of the flame: it shall not be a coal to warm at, nor a fire to sit before.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.47.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>Thus shall the things be to you in which you have labored: those who have trafficked with you from your youth shall wander everyone to his quarter; there shall be no one to save you.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.48.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Hear this, house of Jacob, you who are called by the name of Israel, and have come out of the waters of Judah; who swear by Yahweh&rsquo;s name, and make mention of the God of Israel, but not in truth, nor in righteousness</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.48.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>(for they call themselves of the holy city, and stay themselves on the God of Israel; Yahweh of Armies is his name):</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.48.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>I have declared the former things from of old; yes, they went out of my mouth, and I showed them: suddenly I did them, and they happened.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.48.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>Because I knew that you are obstinate, and your neck is an iron sinew, and your brow brass;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.48.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>therefore I have declared it to you from of old; before it came to pass I showed it to you; lest you should say, &lsquo;My idol has done them, and my engraved image, and my molten image, has commanded them.&rsquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.48.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>You have heard it; see all this; and you, will you not declare it?</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.48.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>They are created now, and not from of old; and before this day you didn&rsquo;t hear them; lest you should say, &lsquo;Behold, I knew them.&rsquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.48.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>Yes, you didn&rsquo;t hear; yes, you didn&rsquo;t know; yes, from of old your ear was not opened: for I knew that you dealt very treacherously, and was called a transgressor from the womb.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.48.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>For my name&rsquo;s sake will I defer my anger, and for my praise will I refrain for you, that I not cut you off.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.48.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>Behold, I have refined you, but not as silver; I have chosen you in the furnace of affliction.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.48.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>For my own sake, for my own sake, will I do it; for how should my name be profaned? I will not give my glory to another.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.48.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Listen to me, O Jacob, and Israel my called: I am he; I am the first, I also am the last.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.48.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>Yes, my hand has laid the foundation of the earth, and my right hand has spread out the heavens: when I call to them, they stand up together.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.48.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Assemble yourselves, all you, and hear; who among them has declared these things? He whom Yahweh loves shall perform his pleasure on Babylon, and his arm shall be on the Chaldeans.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.48.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>I, even I, have spoken; yes, I have called him; I have brought him, and he shall make his way prosperous.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.48.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Come near to me and hear this:</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.48.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span>Thus says Yahweh, your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel: I am Yahweh your God, who teaches you to profit, who leads you by the way that you should go.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.48.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span>Oh that you had listened to my commandments! then your peace would have been like a river, and your righteousness like the waves of the sea:</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.48.19"><span class="verse-num">19&nbsp;</span>your seed also had been as the sand, and the offspring of your body like its grains: his name would not be cut off nor destroyed from before me.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.48.20"><span class="verse-num">20&nbsp;</span>Leave Babylon! Flee from the Chaldeans. With a voice of singing declare, tell this, utter it even to the end of the earth: say, Yahweh has redeemed his servant Jacob.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.48.21"><span class="verse-num">21&nbsp;</span>They didn&rsquo;t thirst when he led them through the deserts; he caused the waters to flow out of the rock for them; he split the rock also, and the waters gushed out.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.48.22"><span class="verse-num">22&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;There is no peace,&rdquo; says Yahweh, &ldquo;for the wicked.&rdquo;</span>

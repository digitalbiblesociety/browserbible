<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.51.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Listen to me, you who follow after righteousness, you who seek Yahweh: look to the rock you were cut from, and to the hold of the pit you were dug from.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.51.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>Look to Abraham your father, and to Sarah who bore you; for when he was but one I called him, and I blessed him, and made him many.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.51.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>For Yahweh has comforted Zion; he has comforted all her waste places, and has made her wilderness like Eden, and her desert like the garden of Yahweh; joy and gladness shall be found therein, thanksgiving, and the voice of melody.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.51.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Attend to me, my people; and give ear to me, my nation: for a law shall go out from me, and I will establish my justice for a light of the peoples.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.51.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>My righteousness is near, my salvation has gone out, and my arms shall judge the peoples; the islands shall wait for me, and on my arm shall they trust.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.51.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>Lift up your eyes to the heavens, and look on the earth beneath; for the heavens shall vanish away like smoke, and the earth shall wax old like a garment; and those who dwell therein shall die in the same way: but my salvation shall be forever, and my righteousness shall not be abolished.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.51.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Listen to me, you who know righteousness, the people in whose heart is my law; don&rsquo;t fear the reproach of men, neither be dismayed at their insults.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.51.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>For the moth shall eat them up like a garment, and the worm shall eat them like wool; but my righteousness shall be forever, and my salvation to all generations.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.51.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>Awake, awake, put on strength, arm of Yahweh; awake, as in the days of old, the generations of ancient times. Isn&rsquo;t it you who cut Rahab in pieces, who pierced the monster?</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.51.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>Isn&rsquo;t it you who dried up the sea, the waters of the great deep; who made the depths of the sea a way for the redeemed to pass over?</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.51.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>The ransomed of Yahweh shall return, and come with singing to Zion; and everlasting joy shall be on their heads. They shall obtain gladness and joy. Sorrow and sighing shall flee away.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.51.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;I, even I, am he who comforts you: who are you, that you are afraid of man who shall die, and of the son of man who shall be made as grass;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.51.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>and have forgotten Yahweh your Maker, who stretched out the heavens, and laid the foundations of the earth; and fear continually all the day because of the fury of the oppressor, when he makes ready to destroy? and where is the fury of the oppressor?</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.51.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>The captive exile shall speedily be freed; and he shall not die and go down into the pit, neither shall his bread fail.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.51.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>For I am Yahweh your God, who stirs up the sea, so that its waves roar: Yahweh of Armies is his name.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.51.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span>I have put my words in your mouth, and have covered you in the shadow of my hand, that I may plant the heavens, and lay the foundations of the earth, and tell Zion, &lsquo;You are my people.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.51.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span>Awake, awake, stand up, Jerusalem, that have drunk at the hand of Yahweh the cup of his wrath; you have drunken the bowl of the cup of staggering, and drained it.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.51.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span>There is no one to guide her among all the sons to whom she has given birth; neither is there any who takes her by the hand among all the sons who she has brought up.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.51.19"><span class="verse-num">19&nbsp;</span>These two things have happened to you. Who will bemoan you? Desolation and destruction, and the famine and the sword; how shall I comfort you?</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.51.20"><span class="verse-num">20&nbsp;</span>Your sons have fainted, they lie at the head of all the streets, as an antelope in a net; they are full of the wrath of Yahweh, the rebuke of your God.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.51.21"><span class="verse-num">21&nbsp;</span>Therefore hear now this, you afflicted, and drunken, but not with wine:</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.51.22"><span class="verse-num">22&nbsp;</span>Thus says your Lord Yahweh, and your God who pleads the cause of his people, &ldquo;Behold, I have taken out of your hand the cup of staggering, even the bowl of the cup of my wrath; you shall no more drink it again:</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.51.23"><span class="verse-num">23&nbsp;</span>and I will put it into the hand of those who afflict you, who have said to your soul, &lsquo;Bow down, that we may walk over you;&rsquo; and you have laid your back as the ground, and as the street, to those who walk over.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse Isa_52_6" data-osis="Isa.52.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>Therefore my people shall know my name. Therefore they shall know in that day that I am he who speaks; behold, it is I.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse Isa_52_12" data-osis="Isa.52.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>For you shall not go out in haste, neither shall you go by flight: for Yahweh will go before you; and the God of Israel will be your rear guard.</span>

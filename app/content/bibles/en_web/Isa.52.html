<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.52.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>Awake, awake, put on your strength, Zion; put on your beautiful garments, Jerusalem, the holy city: for henceforth there shall no more come into you the uncircumcised and the unclean.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.52.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>Shake yourself from the dust! Arise, sit up, Jerusalem! Release yourself from the bonds of your neck, captive daughter of Zion!</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.52.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>For thus says Yahweh, &ldquo;You were sold for nothing; and you shall be redeemed without money.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.52.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>For thus says the Lord Yahweh, &ldquo;My people went down at the first into Egypt to live there: and the Assyrian has oppressed them without cause.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.52.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Now therefore, what do I do here,&rdquo; says Yahweh, &ldquo;seeing that my people are taken away for nothing? Those who rule over them mock,&rdquo; says Yahweh, &ldquo;and my name continually all the day is blasphemed.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.52.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>Therefore my people shall know my name. Therefore they shall know in that day that I am he who speaks; behold, it is I.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.52.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>How beautiful on the mountains are the feet of him who brings good news, who publishes peace, who brings good news of good, who publishes salvation, who says to Zion, &ldquo;Your God reigns!&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.52.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>The voice of your watchmen! they lift up the voice, together do they sing; for they shall see eye to eye, when Yahweh returns to Zion.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.52.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>Break out into joy, sing together, you waste places of Jerusalem; for Yahweh has comforted his people, he has redeemed Jerusalem.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.52.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>Yahweh has made bare his holy arm in the eyes of all the nations; and all the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.52.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>Depart, depart, go out from there, touch no unclean thing! Go out of the midst of her! Cleanse yourselves, you who bear the vessels of Yahweh.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.52.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>For you shall not go out in haste, neither shall you go by flight: for Yahweh will go before you; and the God of Israel will be your rear guard.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.52.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>Behold, my servant shall deal wisely, he shall be exalted and lifted up, and shall be very high.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.52.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>Like as many were astonished at you (his appearance was marred more than any man, and his form more than the sons of men),</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.52.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>so shall he sprinkle many nations; kings shall shut their mouths at him: for that which had not been told them shall they see; and that which they had not heard shall they understand.</span>

<span class="verse Isa_53_1" data-osis="Isa.53.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>Who has believed our message?<br /> To whom has the arm of Yahweh been revealed?<br /></span>
<span class="verse Isa_53_2" data-osis="Isa.53.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>For he grew up before him as a tender plant,<br /> and as a root out of dry ground.<br /> He has no good looks or majesty.<br /> When we see him, there is no beauty that we should desire him.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Isa_53_3" data-osis="Isa.53.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>He was despised,<br /> and rejected by men;<br /> a man of suffering,<br /> and acquainted with disease.<br /> He was despised as one from whom men hide their face;<br /> and we didn&rsquo;t respect him.</span>
<br /><br />
<span class="verse Isa_53_4" data-osis="Isa.53.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>Surely he has borne our sickness,<br /> and carried our suffering;<br /> yet we considered him plagued,<br /> struck by God, and afflicted.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Isa_53_5" data-osis="Isa.53.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>But he was pierced for our transgressions.<br /> He was crushed for our iniquities.<br /> The punishment that brought our peace was on him;<br /> and by his wounds we are healed.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Isa_53_6" data-osis="Isa.53.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>All we like sheep have gone astray.<br /> Everyone has turned to his own way;<br /> and Yahweh has laid on him the iniquity of us all.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Isa_53_7" data-osis="Isa.53.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>He was oppressed,<br /> yet when he was afflicted he didn&rsquo;t open his mouth.<br /> As a lamb that is led to the slaughter,<br /> and as a sheep that before its shearers is mute,<br /> so he didn&rsquo;t open his mouth.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Isa_53_8" data-osis="Isa.53.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>He was taken away by oppression and judgment;<br /> and as for his generation,<br /> who considered that he was cut off out of the land of the living<br /> and stricken for the disobedience of my people?<br /></span>
<span class="verse Isa_53_9" data-osis="Isa.53.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>They made his grave with the wicked,<br /> and with a rich man in his death;<br /> although he had done no violence,<br /> neither was any deceit in his mouth.</span>
<br /><br />
<span class="verse Isa_53_10" data-osis="Isa.53.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>Yet it pleased Yahweh to bruise him.<br /> He has caused him to suffer.<br /> When you make his soul an offering for sin,<br /> he shall see his seed.<br /> He shall prolong his days,<br /> and the pleasure of Yahweh shall prosper in his hand.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Isa_53_11" data-osis="Isa.53.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>After the suffering of his soul,<br /> he will see the light<span class="note"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">So read the Dead Sea Scrolls and Septuagint. Masoretic Text omits &ldquo;the light&rdquo;.</span></span>  and be satisfied.<br /> My righteous servant will justify many by the knowledge of himself;<br /> and he will bear their iniquities.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Isa_53_12" data-osis="Isa.53.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great,<br /> and he shall divide the plunder with the strong;<br /> because he poured out his soul to death,<br /> and was numbered with the transgressors;<br /> yet he bore the sin of many,<br /> and made intercession for the transgressors.</span>

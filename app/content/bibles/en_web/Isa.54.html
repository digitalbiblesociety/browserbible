<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.54.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Sing, barren, you who didn&rsquo;t bear; break out into singing, and cry aloud, you who did not travail with child: for more are the children of the desolate than the children of the married wife,&rdquo; says Yahweh.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.54.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Enlarge the place of your tent, and let them stretch out the curtains of your habitations; don&rsquo;t spare: lengthen your cords, and strengthen your stakes.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.54.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>For you shall spread out on the right hand and on the left; and your seed shall possess the nations, and make the desolate cities to be inhabited.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.54.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid; for you shall not be ashamed: neither be confounded; for you shall not be disappointed: for you shall forget the shame of your youth; and the reproach of your widowhood you shall remember no more.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.54.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>For your Maker is your husband; Yahweh of Armies is his name: and the Holy One of Israel is your Redeemer; the God of the whole earth shall he be called.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.54.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>For Yahweh has called you as a wife forsaken and grieved in spirit, even a wife of youth, when she is cast off,&rdquo; says your God.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.54.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;For a small moment have I forsaken you; but with great mercies will I gather you.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.54.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>In overflowing wrath I hid my face from you for a moment; but with everlasting loving kindness will I have mercy on you,&rdquo; says Yahweh your Redeemer.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.54.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;For this is like the waters of Noah to me; for as I have sworn that the waters of Noah shall no more go over the earth, so have I sworn that I will not be angry with you, nor rebuke you.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.54.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>For the mountains may depart, and the hills be removed; but my loving kindness shall not depart from you, neither shall my covenant of peace be removed,&rdquo; says Yahweh who has mercy on you.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.54.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;You afflicted, tossed with storms, and not comforted, behold, I will set your stones in beautiful colors, and lay your foundations with sapphires.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.54.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>I will make your pinnacles of rubies, and your gates of sparkling jewels, and all your walls of precious stones.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.54.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>All your children shall be taught of Yahweh; and great shall be the peace of your children.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.54.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>In righteousness you shall be established: you shall be far from oppression, for you shall not be afraid; and from terror, for it shall not come near you.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.54.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>Behold, they may gather together, but not by me: whoever shall gather together against you shall fall because of you.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.54.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Behold, I have created the smith who blows the fire of coals, and brings out a weapon for his work; and I have created the waster to destroy.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.54.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span>No weapon that is formed against you will prevail;</span>

<span class="verse Isa_56_2" data-osis="Isa.56.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>Blessed is the man who does this, and the son of man who holds it fast; who keeps the Sabbath from profaning it, and keeps his hand from doing any evil.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Isa_56_3" data-osis="Isa.56.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>Neither let the foreigner, who has joined himself to Yahweh, speak, saying, &ldquo;Yahweh will surely separate me from his people&rdquo;; neither let the eunuch say, &ldquo;Behold, I am a dry tree.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Isa_56_4" data-osis="Isa.56.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>For thus says Yahweh, &ldquo;To the eunuchs who keep my Sabbaths, and choose the things that please me, and hold fast my covenant:</span>
<span class="verse Isa_56_5" data-osis="Isa.56.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>to them I will give in my house and within my walls a memorial and a name better than of sons and of daughters; I will give them an everlasting name, that shall not be cut off.</span>
<span class="verse Isa_56_6" data-osis="Isa.56.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>Also the foreigners who join themselves to Yahweh, to minister to him, and to love Yahweh&rsquo;s name, to be his servants, everyone who keeps the Sabbath from profaning it, and holds fast my covenant;</span>
<span class="verse Isa_56_7" data-osis="Isa.56.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>even them will I bring to my holy mountain, and make them joyful in my house of prayer: their burnt offerings and their sacrifices shall be accepted on my altar; for my house shall be called a house of prayer for all peoples.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Isa_56_8" data-osis="Isa.56.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>The Lord Yahweh, who gathers the outcasts of Israel, says, &ldquo;Yet will I gather others to him, besides his own who are gathered.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse Isa_56_10" data-osis="Isa.56.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>His watchmen are blind, they are all without knowledge; they are all mute dogs, they can&rsquo;t bark; dreaming, lying down, loving to slumber.</span>
<span class="verse Isa_56_11" data-osis="Isa.56.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>Yes, the dogs are greedy, they can never have enough; and these are shepherds who can&rsquo;t understand: they have all turned to their own way, each one to his gain, from every quarter.</span>
<span class="verse Isa_56_12" data-osis="Isa.56.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; say they, &ldquo;I will get wine, and we will fill ourselves with strong drink; and tomorrow shall be as this day, great beyond measure.&rdquo;</span>

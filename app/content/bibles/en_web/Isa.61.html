<span class="verse Isa_61_1" data-osis="Isa.61.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>The Spirit of the Lord Yahweh is on me;<br /> because Yahweh has anointed me to preach good news to the humble.<br /> He has sent me to bind up the broken hearted,<br /> to proclaim liberty to the captives,<br /> and release to those who are bound;<br /></span>
<span class="verse Isa_61_2" data-osis="Isa.61.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>to proclaim the year of Yahweh&rsquo;s favor, and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all who mourn;</span>
<span class="verse Isa_61_3" data-osis="Isa.61.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>to appoint to those who mourn in Zion, to give to them a garland for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness; that they may be called trees of righteousness, the planting of Yahweh, that he may be glorified.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Isa_61_4" data-osis="Isa.61.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>They shall build the old wastes, they shall raise up the former desolations, and they shall repair the waste cities, the desolations of many generations.</span>
<span class="verse Isa_61_5" data-osis="Isa.61.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>Strangers shall stand and feed your flocks, and foreigners shall work your fields and your vineyards.</span>
<span class="verse Isa_61_6" data-osis="Isa.61.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>But you shall be named the priests of Yahweh; men will call you the ministers of our God: you will eat the wealth of the nations, and you will boast in their glory.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Isa_61_7" data-osis="Isa.61.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>Instead of your shame you shall have double; and instead of dishonor they shall rejoice in their portion: therefore in their land they shall possess double; everlasting joy shall be to them.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Isa_61_8" data-osis="Isa.61.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;For I, Yahweh, love justice, I hate robbery with iniquity; and I will give them their recompense in truth, and I will make an everlasting covenant with them.</span>
<span class="verse Isa_61_9" data-osis="Isa.61.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>Their seed shall be known among the nations, and their offspring among the peoples; all who see them shall acknowledge them, that they are the seed which Yahweh has blessed.&rdquo;<br /></span>
<span class="verse Isa_61_10" data-osis="Isa.61.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>I will greatly rejoice in Yahweh, my soul shall be joyful in my God; for he has clothed me with the garments of salvation, he has covered me with the robe of righteousness, as a bridegroom decks himself with a garland, and as a bride adorns herself with her jewels.</span>
<span class="verse Isa_61_11" data-osis="Isa.61.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>For as the earth produces its bud, and as the garden causes the things that are sown in it to spring out; so the Lord Yahweh will cause righteousness and praise to spring out before all the nations.</span>

<span class="verse Isa_63_8" data-osis="Isa.63.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>For he said, &ldquo;Surely, they are my people, children who will not deal falsely:&rdquo; so he was their Savior.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Isa_63_9" data-osis="Isa.63.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>In all their affliction he was afflicted, and the angel of his presence saved them: in his love and in his pity he redeemed them; and he bore them, and carried them all the days of old.</span>
<span class="verse Isa_63_10" data-osis="Isa.63.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>But they rebelled, and grieved his holy Spirit: therefore he was turned to be their enemy, and he himself fought against them.</span>

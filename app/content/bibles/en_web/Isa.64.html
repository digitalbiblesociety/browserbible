<span class="verse Isa_64_1" data-osis="Isa.64.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>Oh that you would tear the heavens, that you would come down, that the mountains might quake at your presence,</span>
<span class="verse Isa_64_2" data-osis="Isa.64.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>as when fire kindles the brushwood, and the fire causes the waters to boil; to make your name known to your adversaries, that the nations may tremble at your presence!</span>
<span class="verse Isa_64_3" data-osis="Isa.64.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>When you did awesome things which we didn&rsquo;t look for, you came down, the mountains quaked at your presence.</span>
<span class="verse Isa_64_4" data-osis="Isa.64.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>For from of old men have not heard, nor perceived by the ear, neither has the eye seen a God besides you, who works for him who waits for him.</span>
<span class="verse Isa_64_5" data-osis="Isa.64.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>You meet him who rejoices and works righteousness, those who remember you in your ways. Behold, you were angry, and we sinned. We have been in sin for a long time; and shall we be saved?</span>
<span class="verse Isa_64_6" data-osis="Isa.64.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>For we have all become as one who is unclean, and all our righteousness is as a polluted garment: and we all fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, take us away.</span>
<span class="verse Isa_64_7" data-osis="Isa.64.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>There is no one who calls on your name, who stirs up himself to take hold of you; for you have hidden your face from us, and have consumed us by means of our iniquities.</span>
<span class="verse Isa_64_8" data-osis="Isa.64.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>But now, Yahweh, you are our Father; we are the clay, and you our potter; and we all are the work of your hand.</span>
<span class="verse Isa_64_9" data-osis="Isa.64.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>Don&rsquo;t be furious, Yahweh, neither remember iniquity forever: see, look, we beg you, we are all your people.</span>
<span class="verse Isa_64_10" data-osis="Isa.64.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>Your holy cities are become a wilderness, Zion has become a wilderness, Jerusalem a desolation.</span>
<span class="verse Isa_64_11" data-osis="Isa.64.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>Our holy and our beautiful house, where our fathers praised you, is burned with fire; and all our pleasant places are laid waste.</span>
<span class="verse Isa_64_12" data-osis="Isa.64.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>Will you refrain yourself for these things, Yahweh? Will you hold your peace, and afflict us very severely?</span>

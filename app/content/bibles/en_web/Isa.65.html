<br /><br />
<span class="verse Isa_65_8" data-osis="Isa.65.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>Thus says Yahweh,<br /> &ldquo;As the new wine is found in the cluster, and one says, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t destroy it, for a blessing is in it:&rsquo; so will I do for my servants&rsquo; sake, that I may not destroy them all.</span>

<span class="verse Isa_65_12" data-osis="Isa.65.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>I will destine you to the sword, and you shall all bow down to the slaughter; because when I called, you didn&rsquo;t answer; when I spoke, you didn&rsquo;t listen; but you did that which was evil in my eyes, and chose that in which I didn&rsquo;t delight.&rdquo;</span>
<br /><br />
<span class="verse Isa_65_13" data-osis="Isa.65.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh, &ldquo;Behold, my servants shall eat, but you shall be hungry; behold, my servants shall drink, but you shall be thirsty; behold, my servants shall rejoice, but you shall be disappointed;</span>
<span class="verse Isa_65_14" data-osis="Isa.65.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>behold, my servants shall sing for joy of heart, but you shall cry for sorrow of heart, and shall wail for anguish of spirit.<br /></span>

<span class="verse Isa_65_18" data-osis="Isa.65.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>But be you glad and rejoice forever in that which I create; for, behold, I create Jerusalem a rejoicing, and her people a joy.</span>

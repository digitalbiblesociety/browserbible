<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.8.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>Yahweh said to me, &ldquo;Take a large tablet, and write on it with a man&rsquo;s pen, &lsquo;For Maher Shalal Hash Baz;<span class="note">+<dfn>&ldquo;Maher Shalal Hash Baz&rdquo; means &ldquo;quick to the plunder, swift to the plunder.&rdquo;</dfn></span>&rsquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.8.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>and I will take for myself faithful witnesses to testify: Uriah the priest, and Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah.&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.8.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>I went to the prophetess, and she conceived, and bore a son. Then Yahweh said to me, &ldquo;Call his name &lsquo;Maher Shalal Hash Baz.&rsquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.8.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>For before the child knows how to say, &lsquo;My father,&rsquo; and, &lsquo;My mother,&rsquo; the riches of Damascus and the plunder of Samaria will be carried away by the king of Assyria.&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.8.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>Yahweh spoke to me yet again, saying,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.8.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Because this people have refused the waters of Shiloah that go softly, and rejoice in Rezin and Remaliah&rsquo;s son;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.8.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>now therefore, behold, the Lord brings upon them the mighty flood waters of the River: the king of Assyria and all his glory. It will come up over all its channels, and go over all its banks.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.8.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>It will sweep onward into Judah. It will overflow and pass through; it will reach even to the neck; and the stretching out of its wings will fill the breadth of your land, Immanuel.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.8.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>Make an uproar, you peoples, and be broken in pieces! Listen, all you from far countries: dress for battle, and be shattered! Dress for battle, and be shattered!</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.8.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>Take counsel together, and it will be brought to nothing; speak the word, and it will not stand: for God is with us.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.8.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>For Yahweh spoke thus to me with a strong hand, and instructed me not to walk in the way of this people, saying,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.8.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say, &lsquo;A conspiracy!&rsquo; concerning all about which this people say, &lsquo;A conspiracy!&rsquo; neither fear their threats, nor be terrorized.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.8.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>Yahweh of Armies is who you must respect as holy. He is the one you must fear. He is the one you must dread.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.8.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>He will be a sanctuary, but for both houses of Israel, he will be a trap and a snare for the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.8.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>Many will stumble over it, fall, be broken, be snared, and be captured.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.8.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span>Wrap up the testimony. Seal the law among my disciples.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.8.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span>I will wait for Yahweh, who hides his face from the house of Jacob, and I will look for him.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.8.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span>Behold, I and the children whom Yahweh has given me are for signs and for wonders in Israel from Yahweh of Armies, who dwells in Mount Zion.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.8.19"><span class="verse-num">19&nbsp;</span>When they tell you, &ldquo;Consult with those who have familiar spirits and with the wizards, who chirp and who mutter:&rdquo; shouldn&rsquo;t a people consult with their God? Should they consult the dead on behalf of the living?</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.8.20"><span class="verse-num">20&nbsp;</span>Turn to the law and to the testimony! If they don&rsquo;t speak according to this word, surely there is no morning for them.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.8.21"><span class="verse-num">21&nbsp;</span>They will pass through it, very distressed and hungry; and it will happen that when they are hungry, they will worry, and curse by their king and by their God. They will turn their faces upward,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.8.22"><span class="verse-num">22&nbsp;</span>and look to the earth, and see distress, darkness, and the gloom of anguish. They will be driven into thick darkness.</span>

<span class="verse Jas_2_1" data-osis="Jas.2.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>My brothers, don&rsquo;t hold the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ of glory with partiality.</span>
<span class="verse Jas_2_2" data-osis="Jas.2.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>For if a man with a gold ring, in fine clothing, comes into your synagogue<span class="note"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">or, meeting</span></span> , and a poor man in filthy clothing also comes in;</span>
<span class="verse Jas_2_3" data-osis="Jas.2.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>and you pay special attention to him who wears the fine clothing, and say, &ldquo;Sit here in a good place&rdquo;; and you tell the poor man, &ldquo;Stand there,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Sit by my footstool&rdquo;;</span>
<span class="verse Jas_2_4" data-osis="Jas.2.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>haven&rsquo;t you shown partiality among yourselves, and become judges with evil thoughts?</span>
<span class="verse Jas_2_5" data-osis="Jas.2.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>Listen, my beloved brothers. Didn&rsquo;t God choose those who are poor in this world to be rich in faith, and heirs of the Kingdom which he promised to those who love him?</span>
<span class="verse Jas_2_6" data-osis="Jas.2.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>But you have dishonored the poor man. Don&rsquo;t the rich oppress you, and personally drag you before the courts?</span>
<span class="verse Jas_2_7" data-osis="Jas.2.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>Don&rsquo;t they blaspheme the honorable name by which you are called?</span>
<span class="verse Jas_2_8" data-osis="Jas.2.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>However, if you fulfill the royal law, according to the Scripture, &ldquo;You shall love your neighbor as yourself,&rdquo;<span class="cf"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">Leviticus 19:18</span></span>  you do well.</span>
<span class="verse Jas_2_9" data-osis="Jas.2.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>But if you show partiality, you commit sin, being convicted by the law as transgressors.</span>
<span class="verse Jas_2_10" data-osis="Jas.2.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>For whoever keeps the whole law, and yet stumbles in one point, he has become guilty of all.</span>
<span class="verse Jas_2_11" data-osis="Jas.2.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>For he who said, &ldquo;Do not commit adultery,&rdquo;<span class="cf"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">Exodus 20:14; Deuteronomy 5:18</span></span>  also said, &ldquo;Do not commit murder.&rdquo;<span class="cf"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">Exodus 10:13; Deuteronomy 5:17</span></span>  Now if you do not commit adultery, but murder, you have become a transgressor of the law.</span>
<span class="verse Jas_2_12" data-osis="Jas.2.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>So speak, and so do, as men who are to be judged by a law of freedom.</span>
<span class="verse Jas_2_13" data-osis="Jas.2.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>For judgment is without mercy to him who has shown no mercy. Mercy triumphs over judgment.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Jas_2_14" data-osis="Jas.2.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>What good is it, my brothers, if a man says he has faith, but has no works? Can faith save him?</span>
<span class="verse Jas_2_15" data-osis="Jas.2.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>And if a brother or sister is naked and in lack of daily food,</span>
<span class="verse Jas_2_16" data-osis="Jas.2.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>and one of you tells them, &ldquo;Go in peace, be warmed and filled&rdquo;; and yet you didn&rsquo;t give them the things the body needs, what good is it?</span>
<span class="verse Jas_2_17" data-osis="Jas.2.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>Even so faith, if it has no works, is dead in itself.</span>
<span class="verse Jas_2_18" data-osis="Jas.2.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>Yes, a man will say, &ldquo;You have faith, and I have works.&rdquo; Show me your faith without works, and I by my works will show you my faith.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Jas_2_19" data-osis="Jas.2.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>You believe that God is one. You do well. The demons also believe, and shudder.</span>
<span class="verse Jas_2_20" data-osis="Jas.2.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>But do you want to know, vain man, that faith apart from works is dead?</span>
<span class="verse Jas_2_21" data-osis="Jas.2.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>Wasn&rsquo;t Abraham our father justified by works, in that he offered up Isaac his son on the altar?</span>
<span class="verse Jas_2_22" data-osis="Jas.2.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>You see that faith worked with his works, and by works faith was perfected;</span>
<span class="verse Jas_2_23" data-osis="Jas.2.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>and the Scripture was fulfilled which says, &ldquo;Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him as righteousness&rdquo;;<span class="cf"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">Genesis 15:6</span></span>  and he was called the friend of God.</span>
<span class="verse Jas_2_24" data-osis="Jas.2.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span>You see then that by works, a man is justified, and not only by faith.</span>
<span class="verse Jas_2_25" data-osis="Jas.2.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span>In the same way, wasn&rsquo;t Rahab the prostitute also justified by works, in that she received the messengers, and sent them out another way?</span>
<span class="verse Jas_2_26" data-osis="Jas.2.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span>For as the body apart from the spirit is dead, even so faith apart from works is dead.</span>

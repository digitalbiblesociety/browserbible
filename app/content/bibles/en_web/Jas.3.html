<span class="verse Jas_3_1" data-osis="Jas.3.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>Let not many of you be teachers, my brothers, knowing that we will receive heavier judgment.</span>
<span class="verse Jas_3_2" data-osis="Jas.3.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>For in many things we all stumble. If anyone doesn&rsquo;t stumble in word, the same is a perfect man, able to bridle the whole body also.</span>
<span class="verse Jas_3_3" data-osis="Jas.3.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>Indeed, we put bits into the horses&rsquo; mouths so that they may obey us, and we guide their whole body.</span>
<span class="verse Jas_3_4" data-osis="Jas.3.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>Behold,<span class="note"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">&ldquo;Behold,&rdquo; from &ldquo;ἰδοὺ,&rdquo; means look at, take notice, observe, see, or gaze at. It is often used as an interjection.</span></span>  the ships also, though they are so big and are driven by fierce winds, are yet guided by a very small rudder, wherever the pilot desires.</span>
<span class="verse Jas_3_5" data-osis="Jas.3.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>So the tongue is also a little member, and boasts great things. See how a small fire can spread to a large forest!</span>
<span class="verse Jas_3_6" data-osis="Jas.3.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>And the tongue is a fire. The world of iniquity among our members is the tongue, which defiles the whole body, and sets on fire the course of nature, and is set on fire by Gehenna.<span class="note"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">or, Hell</span></span> </span>
<span class="verse Jas_3_7" data-osis="Jas.3.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>For every kind of animal, bird, creeping thing, and thing in the sea, is tamed, and has been tamed by mankind.</span>
<span class="verse Jas_3_8" data-osis="Jas.3.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>But nobody can tame the tongue. It is a restless evil, full of deadly poison.</span>
<span class="verse Jas_3_9" data-osis="Jas.3.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>With it we bless our God and Father, and with it we curse men, who are made in the image of God.</span>
<span class="verse Jas_3_10" data-osis="Jas.3.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>Out of the same mouth comes blessing and cursing. My brothers, these things ought not to be so.</span>
<span class="verse Jas_3_11" data-osis="Jas.3.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>Does a spring send out from the same opening fresh and bitter water?</span>
<span class="verse Jas_3_12" data-osis="Jas.3.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>Can a fig tree, my brothers, yield olives, or a vine figs? Thus no spring yields both salt water and fresh water.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Jas_3_13" data-osis="Jas.3.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>Who is wise and understanding among you? Let him show by his good conduct that his deeds are done in gentleness of wisdom.</span>
<span class="verse Jas_3_14" data-osis="Jas.3.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>But if you have bitter jealousy and selfish ambition in your heart, don&rsquo;t boast and don&rsquo;t lie against the truth.</span>
<span class="verse Jas_3_15" data-osis="Jas.3.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>This wisdom is not that which comes down from above, but is earthly, sensual, and demonic.</span>
<span class="verse Jas_3_16" data-osis="Jas.3.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>For where jealousy and selfish ambition are, there is confusion and every evil deed.</span>
<span class="verse Jas_3_17" data-osis="Jas.3.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceful, gentle, reasonable, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy.</span>
<span class="verse Jas_3_18" data-osis="Jas.3.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>Now the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace by those who make peace.</span>

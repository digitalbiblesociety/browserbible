<span class="verse Jas_5_1" data-osis="Jas.5.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>Come now, you rich, weep and howl for your miseries that are coming on you.</span>
<span class="verse Jas_5_2" data-osis="Jas.5.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>Your riches are corrupted and your garments are moth-eaten.</span>
<span class="verse Jas_5_3" data-osis="Jas.5.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>Your gold and your silver are corroded, and their corrosion will be for a testimony against you, and will eat your flesh like fire. You have laid up your treasure in the last days.</span>
<span class="verse Jas_5_4" data-osis="Jas.5.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>Behold, the wages of the laborers who mowed your fields, which you have kept back by fraud, cry out, and the cries of those who reaped have entered into the ears of the Lord of Armies<span class="note">+<dfn>Greek: Sabaoth (for Hebrew: Tze&rsquo;va&rsquo;ot)</dfn></span>.</span>
<span class="verse Jas_5_5" data-osis="Jas.5.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>You have lived delicately on the earth, and taken your pleasure. You have nourished your hearts as in a day of slaughter.</span>
<span class="verse Jas_5_6" data-osis="Jas.5.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>You have condemned, you have murdered the righteous one. He doesn&rsquo;t resist you.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Jas_5_7" data-osis="Jas.5.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>Be patient therefore, brothers, until the coming of the Lord. Behold, the farmer waits for the precious fruit of the earth, being patient over it, until it receives the early and late rain.</span>
<span class="verse Jas_5_8" data-osis="Jas.5.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>You also be patient. Establish your hearts, for the coming of the Lord is at hand.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Jas_5_9" data-osis="Jas.5.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>Don&rsquo;t grumble, brothers, against one another, so that you won&rsquo;t be judged. Behold, the judge stands at the door.</span>
<span class="verse Jas_5_10" data-osis="Jas.5.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>Take, brothers, for an example of suffering and of patience, the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord.</span>
<span class="verse Jas_5_11" data-osis="Jas.5.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>Behold, we call them blessed who endured. You have heard of the patience of Job, and have seen the Lord in the outcome, and how the Lord is full of compassion and mercy.</span>
<span class="verse Jas_5_12" data-osis="Jas.5.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>But above all things, my brothers, don&rsquo;t swear, neither by heaven, nor by the earth, nor by any other oath; but let your &ldquo;yes&rdquo; be &ldquo;yes,&rdquo; and your &ldquo;no,&rdquo; &ldquo;no&rdquo;; so that you don&rsquo;t fall into hypocrisy.<span class="note">+<dfn>TR reads &ldquo;under judgment&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;into hypocrisy&rdquo;</dfn></span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Jas_5_13" data-osis="Jas.5.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>Is any among you suffering? Let him pray. Is any cheerful? Let him sing praises.</span>
<span class="verse Jas_5_14" data-osis="Jas.5.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>Is any among you sick? Let him call for the elders of the assembly, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord,</span>
<span class="verse Jas_5_15" data-osis="Jas.5.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>and the prayer of faith will heal him who is sick, and the Lord will raise him up. If he has committed sins, he will be forgiven.</span>
<span class="verse Jas_5_16" data-osis="Jas.5.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>Confess your offenses to one another, and pray for one another, that you may be healed. The insistent prayer of a righteous person is powerfully effective.</span>
<span class="verse Jas_5_17" data-osis="Jas.5.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>Elijah was a man with a nature like ours, and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain, and it didn&rsquo;t rain on the earth for three years and six months.</span>
<span class="verse Jas_5_18" data-osis="Jas.5.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>He prayed again, and the sky gave rain, and the earth produced its fruit.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Jas_5_19" data-osis="Jas.5.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>Brothers, if any among you wanders from the truth and someone turns him back,</span>
<span class="verse Jas_5_20" data-osis="Jas.5.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>let him know that he who turns a sinner from the error of his way will save a soul from death and will cover a multitude of sins.</span>

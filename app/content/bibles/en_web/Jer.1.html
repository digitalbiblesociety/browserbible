<span class="verse Jer_1_2" data-osis="Jer.1.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>to whom the word of Yahweh<span class="note">+<dfn>&ldquo;Yahweh&rdquo; is God&rsquo;s proper Name, sometimes rendered &ldquo;LORD&rdquo; (all caps) in other translations.</dfn></span> came in the days of Josiah the son of Amon, king of Judah, in the thirteenth year of his reign.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_1_3" data-osis="Jer.1.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>It came also in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, to the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah, the son of Josiah, king of Judah, to the carrying away of Jerusalem captive in the fifth month.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_1_4" data-osis="Jer.1.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>Now the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,</span>
<span class="verse Jer_1_5" data-osis="Jer.1.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Before I formed you in the belly, I knew you. Before you came out of the womb, I sanctified you. I have appointed you a prophet to the nations.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Jer_1_6" data-osis="Jer.1.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>Then I said, &ldquo;Ah, Lord<span class="note">+<dfn>The word translated &ldquo;Lord&rdquo; is &ldquo;Adonai.&rdquo;</dfn></span> Yahweh! Behold,<span class="note">+<dfn>&ldquo;Behold,&rdquo; from &ldquo;הִנֵּה&rdquo;, means look at, take notice, observe, see, or gaze at.

<span class="verse Jer_1_7" data-osis="Jer.1.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>But Yahweh said to me, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say, &lsquo;I am a child;&rsquo; for to whoever I shall send you, you shall go, and whatever I shall command you, you shall speak.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_1_8" data-osis="Jer.1.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>Don&rsquo;t be afraid because of them; for I am with you to deliver you,&rdquo; says Yahweh.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_1_9" data-osis="Jer.1.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>Then Yahweh stretched out his hand, and touched my mouth; and Yahweh said to me, &ldquo;Behold, I have put my words in your mouth.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_1_10" data-osis="Jer.1.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>Behold, I have this day set you over the nations and over the kingdoms, to pluck up and to break down and to destroy and to overthrow, to build and to plant.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Jer_1_11" data-osis="Jer.1.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>Moreover the word of Yahweh came to me, saying, &ldquo;Jeremiah, what do you see?&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse Jer_1_12" data-osis="Jer.1.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>Then Yahweh said to me, &ldquo;You have seen well; for I watch over my word to perform it.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse Jer_1_13" data-osis="Jer.1.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>The word of Yahweh came to me the second time, saying, &ldquo;What do you see?&rdquo;</span>

<p>
<span class="verse Jer_1_14" data-osis="Jer.1.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>Then Yahweh said to me, &ldquo;Out of the north evil will break out on all the inhabitants of the land.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_1_15" data-osis="Jer.1.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>For, behold, I will call all the families of the kingdoms of the north,&rdquo; says Yahweh; &ldquo;and they shall come, and they shall each set his throne at the entrance of the gates of Jerusalem, and against all its walls all around, and against all the cities of Judah.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_1_16" data-osis="Jer.1.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>I will utter my judgments against them touching all their wickedness, in that they have forsaken me, and have burned incense to other gods, and worshiped the works of their own hands.</span>

<span class="verse Jer_1_17" data-osis="Jer.1.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;You therefore put your belt on your waist, arise, and speak to them all that I command you. Don&rsquo;t be dismayed at them, lest I dismay you before them.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_1_18" data-osis="Jer.1.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>For, behold, I have made you this day a fortified city, and an iron pillar, and bronze walls, against the whole land, against the kings of Judah, against its princes, against its priests, and against the people of the land.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_1_19" data-osis="Jer.1.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>They will fight against you; but they will not prevail against you; for I am with you,&rdquo; says Yahweh, &ldquo;to deliver you.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse Jer_12_1" data-osis="Jer.12.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>You are righteous, Yahweh, when I contend with you; yet I would reason the cause with you: why does the way of the wicked prosper? why are all they at ease who deal very treacherously?</span>
<span class="verse Jer_12_2" data-osis="Jer.12.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>You have planted them, yes, they have taken root; they grow, yes, they produce fruit: you are near in their mouth, and far from their heart.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_12_3" data-osis="Jer.12.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>But you, Yahweh, know me; you see me, and try my heart toward you: pull them out like sheep for the slaughter, and prepare them for the day of slaughter.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_12_4" data-osis="Jer.12.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>How long shall the land mourn, and the herbs of the whole country wither? for the wickedness of those who dwell therein, the animals are consumed, and the birds; because they said, He shall not see our latter end.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_12_5" data-osis="Jer.12.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>If you have run with the footmen, and they have wearied you, then how can you contend with horses? and though in a land of peace you are secure, yet how will you do in the pride of the Jordan?</span>
<span class="verse Jer_12_6" data-osis="Jer.12.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>For even your brothers, and the house of your father, even they have dealt treacherously with you; even they have cried aloud after you: don&rsquo;t believe them, though they speak beautiful words to you.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_12_7" data-osis="Jer.12.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>I have forsaken my house, I have cast off my heritage; I have given the dearly beloved of my soul into the hand of her enemies.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_12_8" data-osis="Jer.12.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>My heritage has become to me as a lion in the forest: she has uttered her voice against me; therefore I have hated her.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_12_9" data-osis="Jer.12.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>Is my heritage to me as a speckled bird of prey? are the birds of prey against her all around? Go, assemble all the animals of the field, bring them to devour.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_12_10" data-osis="Jer.12.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>Many shepherds have destroyed my vineyard, they have trodden my portion under foot, they have made my pleasant portion a desolate wilderness.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_12_11" data-osis="Jer.12.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>They have made it a desolation; it mourns to me, being desolate; the whole land is made desolate, because no man lays it to heart.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_12_12" data-osis="Jer.12.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>Destroyers have come on all the bare heights in the wilderness; for the sword of Yahweh devours from the one end of the land even to the other end of the land: no flesh has peace.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_12_13" data-osis="Jer.12.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>They have sown wheat, and have reaped thorns; they have put themselves to pain, and profit nothing: and you shall be ashamed of your fruits, because of the fierce anger of Yahweh.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_12_14" data-osis="Jer.12.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>Thus says Yahweh against all my evil neighbors, who touch the inheritance which I have caused my people Israel to inherit: behold, I will pluck them up from off their land, and will pluck up the house of Judah from among them.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_12_15" data-osis="Jer.12.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>It shall happen, after that I have plucked them up, I will return and have compassion on them; and I will bring them again, every man to his heritage, and every man to his land.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_12_16" data-osis="Jer.12.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>It shall happen, if they will diligently learn the ways of my people, to swear by my name, As Yahweh lives; even as they taught my people to swear by Baal; then shall they be built up in the midst of my people.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_12_17" data-osis="Jer.12.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>But if they will not hear, then I will pluck up that nation, plucking up and destroying it, says Yahweh.</span>

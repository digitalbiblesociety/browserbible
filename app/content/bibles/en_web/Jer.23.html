<span class="verse Jer_23_1" data-osis="Jer.23.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>Woe to the shepherds who destroy and scatter the sheep of my pasture! says Yahweh.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_23_2" data-osis="Jer.23.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>Therefore thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, against the shepherds who feed my people: You have scattered my flock, and driven them away, and have not visited them; behold, I will visit on you the evil of your doings, says Yahweh.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_23_3" data-osis="Jer.23.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>I will gather the remnant of my flock out of all the countries where I have driven them, and will bring them again to their folds; and they shall be fruitful and multiply.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_23_4" data-osis="Jer.23.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>I will set up shepherds over them, who shall feed them; and they shall fear no more, nor be dismayed, neither shall any be lacking, says Yahweh.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_23_5" data-osis="Jer.23.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>Behold, the days come, says Yahweh, that I will raise to David a righteous Branch, and he shall reign as king and deal wisely, and shall execute justice and righteousness in the land.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_23_6" data-osis="Jer.23.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>In his days Judah shall be saved, and Israel shall dwell safely; and this is his name by which he shall be called: Yahweh our righteousness.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_23_7" data-osis="Jer.23.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>Therefore behold, the days come, says Yahweh, that they shall no more say, As Yahweh lives, who brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt;</span>
<span class="verse Jer_23_8" data-osis="Jer.23.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>but, As Yahweh lives, who brought up and who led the seed of the house of Israel out of the north country, and from all the countries where I had driven them. They shall dwell in their own land.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_23_9" data-osis="Jer.23.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>Concerning the prophets. My heart within me is broken, all my bones shake; I am like a drunken man, and like a man whom wine has overcome, because of Yahweh, and because of his holy words.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_23_10" data-osis="Jer.23.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>For the land is full of adulterers; for because of swearing the land mourns; the pastures of the wilderness are dried up. Their course is evil, and their might is not right;</span>
<span class="verse Jer_23_11" data-osis="Jer.23.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>for both prophet and priest are profane; yes, in my house have I found their wickedness, says Yahweh.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_23_12" data-osis="Jer.23.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>Therefore their way shall be to them as slippery places in the darkness: they shall be driven on, and fall therein; for I will bring evil on them, even the year of their visitation, says Yahweh.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_23_13" data-osis="Jer.23.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>I have seen folly in the prophets of Samaria; they prophesied by Baal, and caused my people Israel to err.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_23_14" data-osis="Jer.23.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>In the prophets of Jerusalem also I have seen a horrible thing: they commit adultery, and walk in lies; and they strengthen the hands of evildoers, so that no one returns from his wickedness: they have all become to me as Sodom, and its inhabitants as Gomorrah.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_23_15" data-osis="Jer.23.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>Therefore thus says Yahweh of Armies concerning the prophets: Behold, I will feed them with wormwood, and make them drink the water of gall; for from the prophets of Jerusalem ungodliness has gone out into all the land.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_23_16" data-osis="Jer.23.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>Thus says Yahweh of Armies, Don&rsquo;t listen to the words of the prophets who prophesy to you: they teach you vanity; they speak a vision of their own heart, and not out of the mouth of Yahweh.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_23_17" data-osis="Jer.23.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>They say continually to those who despise me, Yahweh has said, You shall have peace; and to everyone who walks in the stubbornness of his own heart they say, No evil shall come on you.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_23_18" data-osis="Jer.23.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>For who has stood in the council of Yahweh, that he should perceive and hear his word? who has marked my word, and heard it?</span>
<span class="verse Jer_23_19" data-osis="Jer.23.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>Behold, Yahweh&rsquo;s storm, his wrath, has gone out. Yes, a whirling storm. It shall burst on the head of the wicked.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_23_20" data-osis="Jer.23.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>Yahweh&rsquo;s anger shall not return, until he has executed, and until he have performed the intents of his heart: in the latter days you shall understand it perfectly.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_23_21" data-osis="Jer.23.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>I sent not these prophets, yet they ran: I didn&rsquo;t speak to them, yet they prophesied.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_23_22" data-osis="Jer.23.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>But if they had stood in my council, then had they caused my people to hear my words, and had turned them from their evil way, and from the evil of their doings.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_23_23" data-osis="Jer.23.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>Am I a God at hand, says Yahweh, and not a God afar off?</span>
<span class="verse Jer_23_24" data-osis="Jer.23.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span>Can any hide himself in secret places so that I shall not see him? says Yahweh. Don&rsquo;t I fill heaven and earth? says Yahweh.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_23_25" data-osis="Jer.23.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span>I have heard what the prophets have said, who prophesy lies in my name, saying, I have dreamed, I have dreamed.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_23_26" data-osis="Jer.23.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span>How long shall this be in the heart of the prophets who prophesy lies, even the prophets of the deceit of their own heart?</span>
<span class="verse Jer_23_27" data-osis="Jer.23.27"><span class="verse-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span>who think to cause my people to forget my name by their dreams which they tell every man to his neighbor, as their fathers forgot my name for Baal.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_23_28" data-osis="Jer.23.28"><span class="verse-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span>The prophet who has a dream, let him tell a dream; and he who has my word, let him speak my word faithfully. What is the straw to the wheat? says Yahweh.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_23_29" data-osis="Jer.23.29"><span class="verse-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span>Isn&rsquo;t my word like fire? says Yahweh; and like a hammer that breaks the rock in pieces?</span>
<span class="verse Jer_23_30" data-osis="Jer.23.30"><span class="verse-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span>Therefore behold, I am against the prophets, says Yahweh, who steal my words everyone from his neighbor.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_23_31" data-osis="Jer.23.31"><span class="verse-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span>Behold, I am against the prophets, says Yahweh, who use their tongues, and say, He says.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_23_32" data-osis="Jer.23.32"><span class="verse-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span>Behold, I am against those who prophesy lying dreams, says Yahweh, and do tell them, and cause my people to err by their lies, and by their vain boasting: yet I didn&rsquo;t send them, nor commanded them; neither do they profit this people at all, says Yahweh.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_23_33" data-osis="Jer.23.33"><span class="verse-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span>When this people, or the prophet, or a priest, shall ask you, saying, What is the burden of Yahweh? Then you shall tell them, What burden! I will cast you off, says Yahweh.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_23_34" data-osis="Jer.23.34"><span class="verse-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span>As for the prophet, and the priest, and the people, who shall say, The burden of Yahweh, I will even punish that man and his house.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_23_35" data-osis="Jer.23.35"><span class="verse-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span>You shall say everyone to his neighbor, and everyone to his brother, What has Yahweh answered? and, What has Yahweh spoken?</span>
<span class="verse Jer_23_36" data-osis="Jer.23.36"><span class="verse-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span>You shall mention the burden of Yahweh no more: for every man&rsquo;s own word shall be his burden; for you have perverted the words of the living God, of Yahweh of Armies our God.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_23_37" data-osis="Jer.23.37"><span class="verse-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span>You shall say to the prophet, What has Yahweh answered you? and, What has Yahweh spoken?</span>
<span class="verse Jer_23_38" data-osis="Jer.23.38"><span class="verse-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span>But if you say, The burden of Yahweh; therefore thus says Yahweh: Because you say this word, The burden of Yahweh, and I have sent to you, saying, You shall not say, The burden of Yahweh;</span>
<span class="verse Jer_23_39" data-osis="Jer.23.39"><span class="verse-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span>therefore, behold, I will utterly forget you, and I will cast you off, and the city that I gave to you and to your fathers, away from my presence:</span>
<span class="verse Jer_23_40" data-osis="Jer.23.40"><span class="verse-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span>and I will bring an everlasting reproach on you, and a perpetual shame, which shall not be forgotten.</span>

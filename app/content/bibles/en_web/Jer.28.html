<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.28.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>It happened the same year, in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the fourth year, in the fifth month, that Hananiah the son of Azzur, the prophet, who was of Gibeon, spoke to me in the house of Yahweh, in the presence of the priests and of all the people, saying,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.28.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>Thus speaks Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, saying, I have broken the yoke of the king of Babylon.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.28.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>Within two full years will I bring again into this place all the vessels of Yahweh&rsquo;s house, that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took away from this place, and carried to Babylon:</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.28.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>and I will bring again to this place Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, with all the captives of Judah, who went to Babylon, says Yahweh; for I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.28.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>Then the prophet Jeremiah said to the prophet Hananiah in the presence of the priests, and in the presence of all the people who stood in the house of Yahweh,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.28.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>even the prophet Jeremiah said, Amen: Yahweh do so; Yahweh perform your words which you have prophesied, to bring again the vessels of Yahweh&rsquo;s house, and all them of the captivity, from Babylon to this place.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.28.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>Nevertheless hear you now this word that I speak in your ears, and in the ears of all the people:</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.28.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>The prophets who have been before me and before you of old prophesied against many countries, and against great kingdoms, of war, and of evil, and of pestilence.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.28.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>The prophet who prophesies of peace, when the word of the prophet shall happen, then shall the prophet be known, that Yahweh has truly sent him.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.28.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>Then Hananiah the prophet took the bar from off the prophet Jeremiah&rsquo;s neck, and broke it.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.28.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>Hananiah spoke in the presence of all the people, saying, Thus says Yahweh: Even so will I break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon within two full years from off the neck of all the nations. The prophet Jeremiah went his way.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.28.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>Then the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah, after that Hananiah the prophet had broken the bar from off the neck of the prophet Jeremiah, saying,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.28.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>Go, and tell Hananiah, saying, Thus says Yahweh: You have broken the bars of wood; but you have made in their place bars of iron.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.28.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>For thus says Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel: I have put a yoke of iron on the neck of all these nations, that they may serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon; and they shall serve him: and I have given him the animals of the field also.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.28.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>Then the prophet Jeremiah said to Hananiah the prophet, Hear now, Hananiah: Yahweh has not sent you; but you make this people to trust in a lie.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.28.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span>Therefore thus says Yahweh, Behold, I will send you away from off the surface of the earth: this year you shall die, because you have spoken rebellion against Yahweh.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.28.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span>So Hananiah the prophet died the same year in the seventh month.</span>

<span class="verse Jer_30_1" data-osis="Jer.30.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>The word that came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, saying,</span>
<span class="verse Jer_30_2" data-osis="Jer.30.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>Thus speaks Yahweh, the God of Israel, saying, Write all the words that I have spoken to you in a book.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_30_3" data-osis="Jer.30.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>For, behold, the days come, says Yahweh, that I will turn again the captivity of my people Israel and Judah, says Yahweh; and I will cause them to return to the land that I gave to their fathers, and they shall possess it.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_30_4" data-osis="Jer.30.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>These are the words that Yahweh spoke concerning Israel and concerning Judah.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_30_5" data-osis="Jer.30.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>For thus says Yahweh: We have heard a voice of trembling, of fear, and not of peace.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_30_6" data-osis="Jer.30.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>Ask now, and see whether a man does travail with child: why do I see every man with his hands on his waist, as a woman in travail, and all faces are turned into paleness?</span>
<span class="verse Jer_30_7" data-osis="Jer.30.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>Alas! for that day is great, so that none is like it: it is even the time of Jacob&rsquo;s trouble; but he shall be saved out of it.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_30_8" data-osis="Jer.30.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>It shall come to pass in that day, says Yahweh of Armies, that I will break his yoke from off your neck, and will burst your bonds; and strangers shall no more make him their bondservant;</span>
<span class="verse Jer_30_9" data-osis="Jer.30.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>but they shall serve Yahweh their God, and David their king, whom I will raise up to them.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_30_10" data-osis="Jer.30.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>Therefore don&rsquo;t you be afraid, O Jacob my servant, says Yahweh; neither be dismayed, Israel: for, behold, I will save you from afar, and your seed from the land of their captivity; and Jacob shall return, and shall be quiet and at ease, and no one shall make him afraid.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_30_11" data-osis="Jer.30.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>For I am with you, says Yahweh, to save you: for I will make a full end of all the nations where I have scattered you, but I will not make a full end of you; but I will correct you in measure, and will in no way leave you unpunished.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_30_12" data-osis="Jer.30.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>For thus says Yahweh, Your hurt is incurable, and your wound grievous.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_30_13" data-osis="Jer.30.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>There is no one to plead your cause, that you may be bound up: you have no healing medicines.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_30_14" data-osis="Jer.30.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>All your lovers have forgotten you; they don&rsquo;t seek you: for I have wounded you with the wound of an enemy, with the chastisement of a cruel one, for the greatness of your iniquity, because your sins were increased.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_30_15" data-osis="Jer.30.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>Why do you cry for your hurt? Your pain is incurable: for the greatness of your iniquity, because your sins were increased, I have done these things to you.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_30_16" data-osis="Jer.30.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>Therefore all those who devour you shall be devoured; and all your adversaries, everyone of them, shall go into captivity; and those who plunder you shall be plunder, and all who prey on you will I give for a prey.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_30_17" data-osis="Jer.30.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>For I will restore health to you, and I will heal you of your wounds, says Yahweh; because they have called you an outcast, saying, It is Zion, whom no man seeks after.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_30_18" data-osis="Jer.30.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>Thus says Yahweh: Behold, I will turn again the captivity of Jacob&rsquo;s tents, and have compassion on his dwelling places; and the city shall be built on its own hill, and the palace shall be inhabited in its own way.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_30_19" data-osis="Jer.30.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>Out of them shall proceed thanksgiving and the voice of those who make merry: and I will multiply them, and they shall not be few; I will also glorify them, and they shall not be small.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_30_20" data-osis="Jer.30.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>Their children also shall be as before, and their congregation shall be established before me; and I will punish all who oppress them.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_30_21" data-osis="Jer.30.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>Their prince shall be of themselves, and their ruler shall proceed from their midst; and I will cause him to draw near, and he shall approach to me: for who is he who has had boldness to approach to me? says Yahweh.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_30_22" data-osis="Jer.30.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>You shall be my people, and I will be your God.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_30_23" data-osis="Jer.30.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>Behold, Yahweh&rsquo;s storm, his wrath, has gone out, a sweeping storm: it shall burst on the head of the wicked.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_30_24" data-osis="Jer.30.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span>The fierce anger of Yahweh will not return, until he has executed, and until he has performed the intentions of his heart. In the latter days you will understand it.</span>

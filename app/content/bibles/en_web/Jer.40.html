<span class="verse Jer_40_1" data-osis="Jer.40.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>The word which came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, after that Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had let him go from Ramah, when he had taken him being bound in chains among all the captives of Jerusalem and Judah, who were carried away captive to Babylon.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_40_2" data-osis="Jer.40.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>The captain of the guard took Jeremiah, and said to him, Yahweh your God pronounced this evil on this place;</span>
<span class="verse Jer_40_3" data-osis="Jer.40.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>and Yahweh has brought it, and done according as he spoke: because you have sinned against Yahweh, and have not obeyed his voice, therefore this thing has come on you.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_40_4" data-osis="Jer.40.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>Now, behold, I release you this day from the chains which are on your hand. If it seems good to you to come with me into Babylon, come, and I will take care of you; but if it seems bad to you to come with me into Babylon, don&rsquo;t: behold, all the land is before you; where it seems good and right to you to go, there go.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_40_5" data-osis="Jer.40.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>Now while he had not yet gone back, Go back then, he said, to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon has made governor over the cities of Judah, and dwell with him among the people; or go wherever it seems right to you to go. So the captain of the guard gave him food and a present, and let him go.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_40_6" data-osis="Jer.40.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>Then went Jeremiah to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah, and lived with him among the people who were left in the land.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_40_7" data-osis="Jer.40.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>Now when all the captains of the forces who were in the fields, even they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam governor in the land, and had committed to him men, and women, and children, and of the poorest of the land, of those who were not carried away captive to Babylon;</span>
<span class="verse Jer_40_8" data-osis="Jer.40.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>then they came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan and Jonathan the sons of Kareah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth, and the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, and Jezaniah the son of the Maacathite, they and their men.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_40_9" data-osis="Jer.40.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan swore to them and to their men, saying, Don&rsquo;t be afraid to serve the Chaldeans: dwell in the land, and serve the king of Babylon, and it shall be well with you.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_40_10" data-osis="Jer.40.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>As for me, behold, I will dwell at Mizpah, to stand before the Chaldeans who shall come to us: but you, gather wine and summer fruits and oil, and put them in your vessels, and dwell in your cities that you have taken.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_40_11" data-osis="Jer.40.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>Likewise when all the Jews who were in Moab, and among the children of Ammon, and in Edom, and who were in all the countries, heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant of Judah, and that he had set over them Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan;</span>
<span class="verse Jer_40_12" data-osis="Jer.40.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>then all the Jews returned out of all places where they were driven, and came to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah, to Mizpah, and gathered wine and summer fruits very much.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_40_13" data-osis="Jer.40.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>Moreover Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces who were in the fields, came to Gedaliah to Mizpah,</span>
<span class="verse Jer_40_14" data-osis="Jer.40.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>and said to him, Do you know that Baalis the king of the children of Ammon has sent Ishmael the son of Nethaniah to take your life? But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam didn&rsquo;t believe them.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_40_15" data-osis="Jer.40.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>Then Johanan the son of Kareah spoke to Gedaliah in Mizpah secretly, saying, Please let me go, and I will kill Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and no man shall know it: why should he take your life, that all the Jews who are gathered to you should be scattered, and the remnant of Judah perish?</span>
<span class="verse Jer_40_16" data-osis="Jer.40.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam said to Johanan the son of Kareah, You shall not do this thing; for you speak falsely of Ishmael.</span>

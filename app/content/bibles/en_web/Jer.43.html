<span class="verse Jer_43_1" data-osis="Jer.43.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>It happened that, when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking to all the people all the words of Yahweh their God, with which Yahweh their God had sent him to them, even all these words,</span>
<span class="verse Jer_43_2" data-osis="Jer.43.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>then spoke Azariah the son of Hoshaiah, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the proud men, saying to Jeremiah, You speak falsely: Yahweh our God has not sent you to say, You shall not go into Egypt to live there;</span>
<span class="verse Jer_43_3" data-osis="Jer.43.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>but Baruch the son of Neriah sets you on against us, to deliver us into the hand of the Chaldeans, that they may put us to death, and carry us away captive to Babylon.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_43_4" data-osis="Jer.43.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>So Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces, and all the people, didn&rsquo;t obey the voice of Yahweh, to dwell in the land of Judah.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_43_5" data-osis="Jer.43.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>But Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces, took all the remnant of Judah, who were returned from all the nations where they had been driven, to live in the land of Judah;</span>
<span class="verse Jer_43_6" data-osis="Jer.43.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>the men, and the women, and the children, and the king&rsquo;s daughters, and every person who Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had left with Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan; and Jeremiah the prophet, and Baruch the son of Neriah;</span>
<span class="verse Jer_43_7" data-osis="Jer.43.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>and they came into the land of Egypt; for they didn&rsquo;t obey the voice of Yahweh: and they came to Tahpanhes.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_43_8" data-osis="Jer.43.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>Then came the word of Yahweh to Jeremiah in Tahpanhes, saying,</span>
<span class="verse Jer_43_9" data-osis="Jer.43.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>Take great stones in your hand, and hide them in mortar in the brick work, which is at the entry of Pharaoh&rsquo;s house in Tahpanhes, in the sight of the men of Judah;</span>
<span class="verse Jer_43_10" data-osis="Jer.43.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>and tell them, Thus says Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel: Behold, I will send and take Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, my servant, and will set his throne on these stones that I have hidden; and he shall spread his royal pavilion over them.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_43_11" data-osis="Jer.43.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>He shall come, and shall strike the land of Egypt; such as are for death shall be put to death, and such as are for captivity to captivity, and such as are for the sword to the sword.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_43_12" data-osis="Jer.43.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>I will kindle a fire in the houses of the gods of Egypt; and he shall burn them, and carry them away captive: and he shall array himself with the land of Egypt, as a shepherd puts on his garment; and he shall go out from there in peace.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_43_13" data-osis="Jer.43.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>He shall also break the pillars of Beth Shemesh, that is in the land of Egypt; and the houses of the gods of Egypt shall he burn with fire.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.46.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>The word of Yahweh which came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning the nations.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.46.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>Of Egypt: concerning the army of Pharaoh Necoh king of Egypt, which was by the river Euphrates in Carchemish, which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon struck in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.46.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>Prepare the buckler and shield, and draw near to battle!</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.46.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>Harness the horses, and get up, you horsemen, and stand up with your helmets; furbish the spears, put on the coats of mail.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.46.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>Why have I seen it? they are dismayed and are turned backward; and their mighty ones are beaten down, and have fled apace, and don&rsquo;t look back: terror is on every side, says Yahweh.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.46.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>Don&rsquo;t let the swift flee away, nor the mighty man escape; in the north by the river Euphrates have they stumbled and fallen.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.46.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>Who is this who rises up like the Nile, whose waters toss themselves like the rivers?</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.46.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>Egypt rises up like the Nile, and his waters toss themselves like the rivers: and he says, I will rise up, I will cover the earth; I will destroy cities and its inhabitants.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.46.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>Go up, you horses; and rage, you chariots; and let the mighty men go out: Cush and Put, who handle the shield; and the Ludim, who handle and bend the bow.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.46.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>For that day is of the Lord, Yahweh of Armies, a day of vengeance, that he may avenge him of his adversaries: and the sword shall devour and be satiate, and shall drink its fill of their blood; for the Lord, Yahweh of Armies, has a sacrifice in the north country by the river Euphrates.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.46.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>Go up into Gilead, and take balm, virgin daughter of Egypt: in vain do you use many medicines; there is no healing for you.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.46.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>The nations have heard of your shame, and the earth is full of your cry; for the mighty man has stumbled against the mighty, they are fallen both of them together.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.46.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>The word that Yahweh spoke to Jeremiah the prophet, how that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon should come and strike the land of Egypt.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.46.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>Declare in Egypt, and publish in Migdol, and publish in Memphis and in Tahpanhes: say, Stand up, and prepare; for the sword has devoured around you.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.46.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>Why are your strong ones swept away? they didn&rsquo;t stand, because Yahweh pushed them.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.46.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span>He made many to stumble, yes, they fell one on another: and they said, Arise, and let us go again to our own people, and to the land of our birth, from the oppressing sword.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.46.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span>They cried there, Pharaoh king of Egypt is but a noise; he has let the appointed time pass by.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.46.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span>As I live, says the King, whose name is Yahweh of Armies, surely like Tabor among the mountains, and like Carmel by the sea, so shall he come.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.46.19"><span class="verse-num">19&nbsp;</span>You daughter who dwells in Egypt, furnish yourself to go into captivity; for Memphis shall become a desolation, and shall be burnt up, without inhabitant.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.46.20"><span class="verse-num">20&nbsp;</span>Egypt is a very beautiful heifer; but destruction out of the north has come, it has come.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.46.21"><span class="verse-num">21&nbsp;</span>Also her hired men in the midst of her are like calves of the stall; for they also are turned back, they are fled away together, they didn&rsquo;t stand: for the day of their calamity has come on them, the time of their visitation.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.46.22"><span class="verse-num">22&nbsp;</span>The sound of it shall go like the serpent; for they shall march with an army, and come against her with axes, as wood cutters.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.46.23"><span class="verse-num">23&nbsp;</span>They shall cut down her forest, says Yahweh, though it can&rsquo;t be searched; because they are more than the locusts, and are innumerable.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.46.24"><span class="verse-num">24&nbsp;</span>The daughter of Egypt shall be disappointed; she shall be delivered into the hand of the people of the north.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.46.25"><span class="verse-num">25&nbsp;</span>Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, says: Behold, I will punish Amon of No, and Pharaoh, and Egypt, with her gods, and her kings; even Pharaoh, and those who trust in him:</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.46.26"><span class="verse-num">26&nbsp;</span>and I will deliver them into the hand of those who seek their lives, and into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of his servants; and afterwards it shall be inhabited, as in the days of old, says Yahweh.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.46.27"><span class="verse-num">27&nbsp;</span>But don&rsquo;t you be afraid, Jacob my servant, neither be dismayed, Israel: for, behold, I will save you from afar, and your seed from the land of their captivity; and Jacob shall return, and shall be quiet and at ease, and no one shall make him afraid.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.46.28"><span class="verse-num">28&nbsp;</span>Don&rsquo;t you be afraid, O Jacob my servant, says Yahweh; for I am with you: for I will make a full end of all the nations where I have driven you; but I will not make a full end of you, but I will correct you in measure, and will in no way leave you unpunished.</span>

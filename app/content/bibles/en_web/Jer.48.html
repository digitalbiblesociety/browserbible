<span class="verse Jer_48_1" data-osis="Jer.48.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>Of Moab. Thus says Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel: Woe to Nebo! for it is laid waste; Kiriathaim is disappointed, it is taken; Misgab is put to shame and broken down.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_48_2" data-osis="Jer.48.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>The praise of Moab is no more; in Heshbon they have devised evil against her: Come, and let us cut her off from being a nation. You also, Madmen, shall be brought to silence: the sword shall pursue you.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_48_3" data-osis="Jer.48.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>The sound of a cry from Horonaim, desolation and great destruction!</span>
<span class="verse Jer_48_4" data-osis="Jer.48.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>Moab is destroyed; her little ones have caused a cry to be heard.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_48_5" data-osis="Jer.48.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>For by the ascent of Luhith with continual weeping shall they go up; for at the descent of Horonaim they have heard the distress of the cry of destruction.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_48_6" data-osis="Jer.48.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>Flee, save your lives, and be like the heath in the wilderness.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_48_7" data-osis="Jer.48.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>For, because you have trusted in your works and in your treasures, you also shall be taken: and Chemosh shall go out into captivity, his priests and his princes together.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_48_8" data-osis="Jer.48.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>The destroyer shall come on every city, and no city shall escape; the valley also shall perish, and the plain shall be destroyed; as Yahweh has spoken.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_48_9" data-osis="Jer.48.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>Give wings to Moab, that she may fly and get her away: and her cities shall become a desolation, without any to dwell therein.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_48_10" data-osis="Jer.48.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>Cursed is he who does the work of Yahweh negligently; and cursed is he who keeps back his sword from blood.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_48_11" data-osis="Jer.48.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>Moab has been at ease from his youth, and he has settled on his lees, and has not been emptied from vessel to vessel, neither has he gone into captivity: therefore his taste remains in him, and his scent is not changed.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_48_12" data-osis="Jer.48.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>Therefore behold, the days come, says Yahweh, that I will send to him those who pour off, and they shall pour him off; and they shall empty his vessels, and break their bottles in pieces.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_48_13" data-osis="Jer.48.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>Moab shall be ashamed of Chemosh, as the house of Israel was ashamed of Bethel their confidence.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_48_14" data-osis="Jer.48.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>How do you say, We are mighty men, and valiant men for the war?</span>
<span class="verse Jer_48_15" data-osis="Jer.48.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>Moab is laid waste, and they are gone up into his cities, and his chosen young men are gone down to the slaughter, says the King, whose name is Yahweh of Armies.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_48_16" data-osis="Jer.48.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>The calamity of Moab is near to come, and his affliction hurries fast.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_48_17" data-osis="Jer.48.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>All you who are around him, bemoan him, and all you who know his name; say, How is the strong staff broken, the beautiful rod!</span>
<span class="verse Jer_48_18" data-osis="Jer.48.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>You daughter who dwells in Dibon, come down from your glory, and sit in thirst; for the destroyer of Moab has come up against you, he has destroyed your strongholds.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_48_19" data-osis="Jer.48.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>Inhabitant of Aroer, stand by the way, and watch: ask him who flees, and her who escapes; say, What has been done?</span>
<span class="verse Jer_48_20" data-osis="Jer.48.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>Moab is disappointed; for it is broken down: wail and cry; tell it by the Arnon, that Moab is laid waste.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_48_21" data-osis="Jer.48.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>Judgment has come on the plain country, on Holon, and on Jahzah, and on Mephaath,</span>
<span class="verse Jer_48_22" data-osis="Jer.48.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>and on Dibon, and on Nebo, and on Beth Diblathaim,</span>
<span class="verse Jer_48_23" data-osis="Jer.48.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>and on Kiriathaim, and on Beth Gamul, and on Beth Meon,</span>
<span class="verse Jer_48_24" data-osis="Jer.48.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span>and on Kerioth, and on Bozrah, and on all the cities of the land of Moab, far or near.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_48_25" data-osis="Jer.48.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span>The horn of Moab is cut off, and his arm is broken, says Yahweh.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_48_26" data-osis="Jer.48.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span>Make him drunken; for he magnified himself against Yahweh: and Moab shall wallow in his vomit, and he also shall be in derision.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_48_27" data-osis="Jer.48.27"><span class="verse-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span>For wasn&rsquo;t Israel a derision to you? was he found among thieves? for as often as you speak of him, you shake your head.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_48_28" data-osis="Jer.48.28"><span class="verse-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span>You inhabitants of Moab, leave the cities, and dwell in the rock; and be like the dove that makes her nest over the mouth of the abyss.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_48_29" data-osis="Jer.48.29"><span class="verse-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span>We have heard of the pride of Moab. He is very proud; his loftiness, and his pride, and his arrogance, and the haughtiness of his heart.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_48_30" data-osis="Jer.48.30"><span class="verse-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span>I know his wrath, says Yahweh, that it is nothing; his boastings have worked nothing.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_48_31" data-osis="Jer.48.31"><span class="verse-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span>Therefore will I wail for Moab; yes, I will cry out for all Moab: for the men of Kir Heres shall they mourn.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_48_32" data-osis="Jer.48.32"><span class="verse-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span>With more than the weeping of Jazer will I weep for you, vine of Sibmah: your branches passed over the sea, they reached even to the sea of Jazer: on your summer fruits and on your vintage the destroyer is fallen.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_48_33" data-osis="Jer.48.33"><span class="verse-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span>Gladness and joy is taken away from the fruitful field and from the land of Moab; and I have caused wine to cease from the wine presses: no one shall tread with shouting; the shouting shall be no shouting.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_48_34" data-osis="Jer.48.34"><span class="verse-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span>From the cry of Heshbon even to Elealeh, even to Jahaz have they uttered their voice, from Zoar even to Horonaim, to Eglath Shelishiyah: for the waters of Nimrim also shall become desolate.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_48_35" data-osis="Jer.48.35"><span class="verse-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span>Moreover I will cause to cease in Moab, says Yahweh, him who offers in the high place, and him who burns incense to his gods.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_48_36" data-osis="Jer.48.36"><span class="verse-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span>Therefore my heart sounds for Moab like pipes, and my heart sounds like pipes for the men of Kir Heres: therefore the abundance that he has gotten is perished.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_48_37" data-osis="Jer.48.37"><span class="verse-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span>For every head is bald, and every beard clipped: on all the hands are cuttings, and on the waist sackcloth.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_48_38" data-osis="Jer.48.38"><span class="verse-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span>On all the housetops of Moab and in its streets there is lamentation every where; for I have broken Moab like a vessel in which no one delights, says Yahweh.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_48_39" data-osis="Jer.48.39"><span class="verse-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span>How it is broken down! How they wail! How Moab has turned the back with shame! So shall Moab become a derision and a terror to all who are around him.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_48_40" data-osis="Jer.48.40"><span class="verse-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span>For thus says Yahweh: Behold, he shall fly as an eagle, and shall spread out his wings against Moab.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_48_41" data-osis="Jer.48.41"><span class="verse-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span>Kerioth is taken, and the strongholds are seized, and the heart of the mighty men of Moab at that day shall be as the heart of a woman in her pangs.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_48_42" data-osis="Jer.48.42"><span class="verse-num v-42">42&nbsp;</span>Moab shall be destroyed from being a people, because he has magnified himself against Yahweh.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_48_43" data-osis="Jer.48.43"><span class="verse-num v-43">43&nbsp;</span>Fear, and the pit, and the snare, are on you, inhabitant of Moab, says Yahweh.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_48_44" data-osis="Jer.48.44"><span class="verse-num v-44">44&nbsp;</span>He who flees from the fear shall fall into the pit; and he who gets up out of the pit shall be taken in the snare: for I will bring on him, even on Moab, the year of their visitation, says Yahweh.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_48_45" data-osis="Jer.48.45"><span class="verse-num v-45">45&nbsp;</span>Those who fled stand without strength under the shadow of Heshbon; for a fire is gone out of Heshbon, and a flame from the midst of Sihon, and has devoured the corner of Moab, and the crown of the head of the tumultuous ones.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_48_46" data-osis="Jer.48.46"><span class="verse-num v-46">46&nbsp;</span>Woe to you, O Moab! the people of Chemosh is undone; for your sons are taken away captive, and your daughters into captivity.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_48_47" data-osis="Jer.48.47"><span class="verse-num v-47">47&nbsp;</span>Yet will I bring back the captivity of Moab in the latter days, says Yahweh. Thus far is the judgment of Moab.</span>

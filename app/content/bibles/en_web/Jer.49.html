<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.49.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>Of the children of Ammon. Thus says Yahweh: Has Israel no sons? has he no heir? why then does Malcam possess Gad, and his people well in its cities?</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.49.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>Therefore behold, the days come, says Yahweh, that I will cause an alarm of war to be heard against Rabbah of the children of Ammon; and it shall become a desolate heap, and her daughters shall be burned with fire: then shall Israel possess those who possessed him, says Yahweh.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.49.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>Wail, Heshbon, for Ai is laid waste; cry, you daughters of Rabbah, clothe yourself in sackcloth: lament, and run back and forth among the fences; for Malcam shall go into captivity, his priests and his princes together.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.49.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>Why do you glory in the valleys, your flowing valley, backsliding daughter? who trusted in her treasures, saying, Who shall come to me?</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.49.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>Behold, I will bring a fear on you, says the Lord, Yahweh of Armies, from all who are around you; and you shall be driven out every man right out, and there shall be no one to gather together the fugitives.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.49.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>But afterward I will bring back the captivity of the children of Ammon, says Yahweh.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.49.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>Of Edom. Thus says Yahweh of Armies: Is wisdom no more in Teman? is counsel perished from the prudent? is their wisdom vanished?</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.49.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>Flee, turn back, dwell in the depths, inhabitants of Dedan; for I will bring the calamity of Esau on him, the time that I shall visit him.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.49.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>If grape gatherers came to you, would they not leave some gleaning grapes? if thieves by night, wouldn&rsquo;t they destroy until they had enough?</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.49.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>But I have made Esau bare, I have uncovered his secret places, and he shall not be able to hide himself: his seed is destroyed, and his brothers, and his neighbors; and he is no more.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.49.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>Leave your fatherless children, I will preserve them alive; and let your widows trust in me.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.49.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>For thus says Yahweh: Behold, they to whom it didn&rsquo;t pertain to drink of the cup shall certainly drink; and are you he who shall altogether go unpunished? You shall not go unpunished, but you shall surely drink.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.49.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>For I have sworn by myself, says Yahweh, that Bozrah shall become an astonishment, a reproach, a waste, and a curse; and all its cities shall be perpetual wastes.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.49.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>I have heard news from Yahweh, and an ambassador is sent among the nations, saying, Gather yourselves together, and come against her, and rise up to the battle.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.49.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>For, behold, I have made you small among the nations, and despised among men.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.49.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span>As for your terror, the pride of your heart has deceived you, O you who dwell in the clefts of the rock, who hold the height of the hill: though you should make your nest as high as the eagle, I will bring you down from there, says Yahweh.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.49.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span>Edom shall become an astonishment: everyone who passes by it shall be astonished, and shall hiss at all its plagues.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.49.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span>As in the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighbor cities of it, says Yahweh, no man shall dwell there, neither shall any son of man live therein.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.49.19"><span class="verse-num">19&nbsp;</span>Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the pride of the Jordan against the strong habitation: for I will suddenly make them run away from it; and whoever is chosen, him will I appoint over it: for who is like me? and who will appoint me a time? and who is the shepherd who will stand before me?</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.49.20"><span class="verse-num">20&nbsp;</span>Therefore hear the counsel of Yahweh, that he has taken against Edom; and his purposes, that he has purposed against the inhabitants of Teman: Surely they shall drag them away, the little ones of the flock; surely he shall make their habitation desolate over them.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.49.21"><span class="verse-num">21&nbsp;</span>The earth trembles at the noise of their fall; there is a cry, the noise which is heard in the Red Sea.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.49.22"><span class="verse-num">22&nbsp;</span>Behold, he shall come up and fly as the eagle, and spread out his wings against Bozrah: and the heart of the mighty men of Edom at that day shall be as the heart of a woman in her pangs.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.49.23"><span class="verse-num">23&nbsp;</span>Of Damascus. Hamath is confounded, and Arpad; for they have heard evil news, they are melted away: there is sorrow on the sea; it can&rsquo;t be quiet.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.49.24"><span class="verse-num">24&nbsp;</span>Damascus has grown feeble, she turns herself to flee, and trembling has seized on her: anguish and sorrows have taken hold of her, as of a woman in travail.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.49.25"><span class="verse-num">25&nbsp;</span>How is the city of praise not forsaken, the city of my joy?</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.49.26"><span class="verse-num">26&nbsp;</span>Therefore her young men shall fall in her streets, and all the men of war shall be brought to silence in that day, says Yahweh of Armies.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.49.27"><span class="verse-num">27&nbsp;</span>I will kindle a fire in the wall of Damascus, and it shall devour the palaces of Ben Hadad.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.49.28"><span class="verse-num">28&nbsp;</span>Of Kedar, and of the kingdoms of Hazor, which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon struck. Thus says Yahweh: Arise, go up to Kedar, and destroy the children of the east.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.49.29"><span class="verse-num">29&nbsp;</span>Their tents and their flocks shall they take; they shall carry away for themselves their curtains, and all their vessels, and their camels; and they shall cry to them, Terror on every side!</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.49.30"><span class="verse-num">30&nbsp;</span>Flee, wander far off, dwell in the depths, you inhabitants of Hazor, says Yahweh; for Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon has taken counsel against you, and has conceived a purpose against you.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.49.31"><span class="verse-num">31&nbsp;</span>Arise, go up to a nation that is at ease, that dwells without care, says Yahweh; that have neither gates nor bars, that dwell alone.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.49.32"><span class="verse-num">32&nbsp;</span>Their camels shall be a booty, and the multitude of their livestock a plunder: and I will scatter to all winds those who have the corners of their beards cut off; and I will bring their calamity from every side of them, says Yahweh.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.49.33"><span class="verse-num">33&nbsp;</span>Hazor shall be a dwelling place of jackals, a desolation forever: no man shall dwell there, neither shall any son of man live therein.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.49.34"><span class="verse-num">34&nbsp;</span>The word of Yahweh that came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning Elam, in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, saying,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.49.35"><span class="verse-num">35&nbsp;</span>Thus says Yahweh of Armies: Behold, I will break the bow of Elam, the chief of their might.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.49.36"><span class="verse-num">36&nbsp;</span>On Elam will I bring the four winds from the four quarters of the sky, and will scatter them toward all those winds; and there shall be no nation where the outcasts of Elam shall not come.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.49.37"><span class="verse-num">37&nbsp;</span>I will cause Elam to be dismayed before their enemies, and before those who seek their life; and I will bring evil on them, even my fierce anger, says Yahweh; and I will send the sword after them, until I have consumed them;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.49.38"><span class="verse-num">38&nbsp;</span>and I will set my throne in Elam, and will destroy from there king and princes, says Yahweh.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.49.39"><span class="verse-num">39&nbsp;</span>But it shall happen in the latter days, that I will bring back the captivity of Elam, says Yahweh.</span>

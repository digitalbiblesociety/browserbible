<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.52.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he began to reign; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem: and his mother&rsquo;s name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.52.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>He did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, according to all that Jehoiakim had done.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.52.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>For through Yahweh&rsquo;s anger it happened in Jerusalem and Judah, until he had cast them out from his presence. Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.52.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>It happened in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came, he and all his army, against Jerusalem, and encamped against it; and they built forts against it round about.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.52.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>So the city was besieged to the eleventh year of king Zedekiah.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.52.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>In the fourth month, in the ninth day of the month, the famine was severe in the city, so that there was no bread for the people of the land.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.52.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>Then a breach was made in the city, and all the men of war fled, and went out of the city by night by the way of the gate between the two walls, which was by the king&rsquo;s garden; (now the Chaldeans were against the city all around;) and they went toward the Arabah.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.52.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>But the army of the Chaldeans pursued after the king, and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho; and all his army was scattered from him.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.52.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>Then they took the king, and carried him up to the king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath; and he gave judgment on him.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.52.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>The king of Babylon killed the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes: he killed also all the princes of Judah in Riblah.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.52.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>He put out the eyes of Zedekiah; and the king of Babylon bound him in fetters, and carried him to Babylon, and put him in prison until the day of his death.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.52.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>Now in the fifth month, in the tenth day of the month, which was the nineteenth year of king Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, came Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, who stood before the king of Babylon, into Jerusalem:</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.52.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>and he burned the house of Yahweh, and the king&rsquo;s house; and all the houses of Jerusalem, even every great house, he burned with fire.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.52.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>All the army of the Chaldeans, who were with the captain of the guard, broke down all the walls of Jerusalem all around.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.52.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive of the poorest of the people, and the residue of the people who were left in the city, and those who fell away, who fell to the king of Babylon, and the residue of the multitude.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.52.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span>But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left of the poorest of the land to be vineyard keepers and farmers.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.52.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span>The Chaldeans broke the pillars of brass that were in the house of Yahweh, and the bases and the bronze sea that were in the house of Yahweh in pieces, and carried all of their brass to Babylon.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.52.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span>They also took away the pots, the shovels, the snuffers, the basins, the spoons, and all the vessels of brass with which they ministered.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.52.19"><span class="verse-num">19&nbsp;</span>The captain of the guard took away the cups, the fire pans, the basins, the pots, the lamp stands, the spoons, and the bowls; that which was of gold, in gold, and that which was of silver, in silver.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.52.20"><span class="verse-num">20&nbsp;</span>They took the two pillars, the one sea, and the twelve bronze bulls that were under the bases, which king Solomon had made for the house of Yahweh. The brass of all these vessels was without weight.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.52.21"><span class="verse-num">21&nbsp;</span>As for the pillars, the height of the one pillar was eighteen cubits; and a line of twelve cubits encircled it; and its thickness was four fingers. It was hollow.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.52.22"><span class="verse-num">22&nbsp;</span>A capital of brass was on it; and the height of the one capital was five cubits, with network and pomegranates on the capital all around, all of brass: and the second pillar also had like these, and pomegranates.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.52.23"><span class="verse-num">23&nbsp;</span>There were ninety-six pomegranates on the sides; all the pomegranates were one hundred on the network all around.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.52.24"><span class="verse-num">24&nbsp;</span>The captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the threshold:</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.52.25"><span class="verse-num">25&nbsp;</span>and out of the city he took an officer who was set over the men of war; and seven men of those who saw the king&rsquo;s face, who were found in the city; and the scribe of the captain of the army, who mustered the people of the land; and sixty men of the people of the land, who were found in the midst of the city.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.52.26"><span class="verse-num">26&nbsp;</span>Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them, and brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.52.27"><span class="verse-num">27&nbsp;</span>The king of Babylon struck them, and put them to death at Riblah in the land of Hamath. So Judah was carried away captive out of his land.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.52.28"><span class="verse-num">28&nbsp;</span>This is the people whom Nebuchadnezzar carried away captive: in the seventh year three thousand twenty-three Jews;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.52.29"><span class="verse-num">29&nbsp;</span>in the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar he carried away captive from Jerusalem eight hundred thirty-two persons;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.52.30"><span class="verse-num">30&nbsp;</span>in the twenty-third year of Nebuchadnezzar Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive of the Jews seven hundred forty-five persons: all the persons were four thousand and six hundred.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.52.31"><span class="verse-num">31&nbsp;</span>It happened in the thirty-seventh year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, in the twenty-fifth day of the month, that Evilmerodach king of Babylon, in the first year of his reign, lifted up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah, and released him from prison;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.52.32"><span class="verse-num">32&nbsp;</span>and he spoke kindly to him, and set his throne above the throne of the kings who were with him in Babylon,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.52.33"><span class="verse-num">33&nbsp;</span>and changed his prison garments. Jehoiachin ate bread before him continually all the days of his life:</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.52.34"><span class="verse-num">34&nbsp;</span>and for his allowance, there was a continual allowance given him by the king of Babylon, every day a portion until the day of his death, all the days of his life.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.57.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>The righteous perishes, and no man lays it to heart; and merciful men are taken away, no one considering that the righteous is taken away from the evil.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.57.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>He enters into peace; they rest in their beds, each one who walks in his uprightness.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.57.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;But draw near here, you sons of the sorceress, the seed of the adulterer and the prostitute.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.57.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>Against whom do you sport yourselves? Against whom do you make a wide mouth, and stick out your tongue? Aren&rsquo;t you children of disobedience, a seed of falsehood,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.57.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>you who inflame yourselves among the oaks, under every green tree; who kill the children in the valleys, under the clefts of the rocks?</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.57.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>Among the smooth stones of the valley is your portion; they, they are your lot; you have even poured a drink offering to them. You have offered an offering. Shall I be appeased for these things?</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.57.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>On a high and lofty mountain you have set your bed; there also you went up to offer sacrifice.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.57.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>Behind the doors and the posts you have set up your memorial:</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.57.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>You went to the king with oil, and increased your perfumes, and sent your ambassadors far off, and debased yourself even to Sheol<span class="note"> <dfn>+ Sheol is the place of the dead.</dfn></span>.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.57.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>You were wearied with the length of your way; yet you didn&rsquo;t say, &lsquo;It is in vain.&rsquo; You found a reviving of your strength; therefore you weren&rsquo;t faint.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.57.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Of whom have you been afraid and in fear, that you lie, and have not remembered me, nor laid it to your heart? Haven&rsquo;t I held my peace even of long time, and you don&rsquo;t fear me?</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.57.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>I will declare your righteousness; and as for your works, they shall not profit you.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.57.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>When you cry, let those who you have gathered deliver you; but the wind shall take them, a breath shall carry them all away: but he who takes refuge in me shall possess the land, and shall inherit my holy mountain.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.57.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>He will say, &ldquo;Cast up, cast up, prepare the way,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.57.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>For thus says the high and lofty One who inhabits eternity, whose name is Holy:</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.57.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span>For I will not contend forever, neither will I be always angry; for the spirit would faint before me, and the souls who I have made.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.57.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span>For the iniquity of his covetousness was I angry, and struck him; I hid myself and was angry; and he went on backsliding in the way of his heart.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.57.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span>I have seen his ways, and will heal him: I will lead him also, and restore comforts to him and to his mourners.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.57.19"><span class="verse-num">19&nbsp;</span>I create the fruit of the lips: Peace, peace, to him who is far off and to him who is near,&rdquo; says Yahweh; &ldquo;and I will heal them.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.57.20"><span class="verse-num">20&nbsp;</span>But the wicked are like the troubled sea; for it can&rsquo;t rest, and its waters cast up mire and dirt.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.57.21"><span class="verse-num">21&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;There is no peace,&rdquo; says my God, &ldquo;for the wicked.&rdquo;</span>

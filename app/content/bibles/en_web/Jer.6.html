<p>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.6.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Flee for safety, you children of Benjamin, out of the midst of Jerusalem, and blow the trumpet in Tekoa, and raise up a signal on Beth Haccherem; for evil looks out from the north, and a great destruction.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.6.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>The comely and delicate one, the daughter of Zion, will I cut off.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.6.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>Shepherds with their flocks shall come to her; they shall pitch their tents against her all around; they shall feed everyone in his place.&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.6.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Prepare war against her; arise, and let us go up at noon. Woe to us! For the day declines, for the shadows of the evening are stretched out.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.6.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>Arise, and let us go up by night, and let us destroy her palaces.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.6.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>For Yahweh of Armies said, &ldquo;Cut down trees, and cast up a mound against Jerusalem: this is the city to be visited; she is wholly oppression in the midst of her.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.6.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>As a well produces its waters, so she produces her wickedness: violence and destruction is heard in her; before me continually is sickness and wounds.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.6.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>Be instructed, Jerusalem, lest my soul be alienated from you; lest I make you a desolation, a land not inhabited.&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.6.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>Thus says Yahweh of Armies, &ldquo;They shall thoroughly glean the remnant of Israel like a vine. Turn again your hand as a grape gatherer into the baskets.&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.6.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>To whom shall I speak and testify, that they may hear? Behold, their ear is uncircumcised, and they can&rsquo;t listen. Behold, the word of Yahweh has become a reproach to them. They have no delight in it.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.6.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>Therefore I am full of the wrath of Yahweh. I am weary with holding in.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.6.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>Their houses shall be turned to others,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.6.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;For from their least even to their greatest, everyone is given to covetousness;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.6.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>They have healed also the hurt of my people superficially,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.6.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination?</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.6.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span>Thus says Yahweh, &ldquo;Stand in the ways and see, and ask for the old paths, &lsquo;Where is the good way?&rsquo; and walk in it, and you will find rest for your souls. But they said, &lsquo;We will not walk in it.&rsquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.6.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span>I set watchmen over you, saying, &lsquo;Listen to the sound of the trumpet!&rsquo; But they said, &lsquo;We will not listen!&rsquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.6.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span>Therefore hear, you nations, and know, congregation, what is among them.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.6.19"><span class="verse-num">19&nbsp;</span>Hear, earth! Behold, I will bring evil on this people, even the fruit of their thoughts, because they have not listened to my words; and as for my law, they have rejected it.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.6.20"><span class="verse-num">20&nbsp;</span>To what purpose comes there to me frankincense from Sheba, and the sweet cane from a far country? your burnt offerings are not acceptable, nor your sacrifices pleasing to me.&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.6.21"><span class="verse-num">21&nbsp;</span>Therefore thus says Yahweh, &ldquo;Behold, I will lay stumbling blocks before this people. The fathers and the sons together shall stumble against them. The neighbor and his friend shall perish.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.6.22"><span class="verse-num">22&nbsp;</span>Thus says Yahweh, &ldquo;Behold, a people comes from the north country. A great nation shall be stirred up from the uttermost parts of the earth.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.6.23"><span class="verse-num">23&nbsp;</span>They take hold of bow and spear. They are cruel, and have no mercy. Their voice roars like the sea, and they ride on horses, everyone set in array, as a man to the battle, against you, daughter of Zion.&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.6.24"><span class="verse-num">24&nbsp;</span>We have heard its report; our hands become feeble: anguish has taken hold of us, and pains as of a woman in labor.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.6.25"><span class="verse-num">25&nbsp;</span>Don&rsquo;t go out into the field, nor walk by the way; for the sword of the enemy and terror, are on every side.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.6.26"><span class="verse-num">26&nbsp;</span>Daughter of my people, clothe yourself with sackcloth, and wallow in ashes! Mourn, as for an only son, most bitter lamentation; for the destroyer shall suddenly come on us.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.6.27"><span class="verse-num">27&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;I have made you a tester of metals and a fortress among my people; that you may know and try their way.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.6.28"><span class="verse-num">28&nbsp;</span>They are all grievous rebels, going about with slanders; they are brass and iron: they all of them deal corruptly.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.6.29"><span class="verse-num">29&nbsp;</span>The bellows blow fiercely; the lead is consumed of the fire: in vain do they go on refining; for the wicked are not plucked away.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.6.30"><span class="verse-num">30&nbsp;</span>Men will call them rejected silver, because Yahweh has rejected them.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.65.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;I am inquired of by those who didn&rsquo;t ask; I am found by those who didn&rsquo;t seek me: I said, See me, see me, to a nation that was not called by my name.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.65.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>I have spread out my hands all the day to a rebellious people, who walk in a way that is not good, after their own thoughts;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.65.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>a people who provoke me to my face continually, sacrificing in gardens, and burning incense on bricks;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.65.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>who sit among the graves, and lodge in the secret places; who eat pig&rsquo;s flesh, and broth of abominable things is in their vessels;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.65.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>who say, Stand by yourself, don&rsquo;t come near to me, for I am holier than you. These are a smoke in my nose, a fire that burns all the day.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.65.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Behold, it is written before me: I will not keep silence, but will recompense, yes, I will recompense into their bosom,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.65.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>your own iniquities, and the iniquities of your fathers together,&rdquo; says Yahweh, &ldquo;who have burned incense on the mountains, and blasphemed me on the hills; therefore will I first measure their work into their bosom.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.65.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>Thus says Yahweh,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.65.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>I will bring a seed out of Jacob, and out of Judah an inheritor of my mountains; and my chosen shall inherit it, and my servants shall dwell there.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.65.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>Sharon shall be a fold of flocks, and the valley of Achor a place for herds to lie down in, for my people who have sought me.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.65.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;But you who forsake Yahweh, who forget my holy mountain, who prepare a table for Fortune, and who fill up mixed wine to Destiny;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.65.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>I will destine you to the sword, and you shall all bow down to the slaughter; because when I called, you didn&rsquo;t answer; when I spoke, you didn&rsquo;t listen; but you did that which was evil in my eyes, and chose that in which I didn&rsquo;t delight.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.65.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh, &ldquo;Behold, my servants shall eat, but you shall be hungry; behold, my servants shall drink, but you shall be thirsty; behold, my servants shall rejoice, but you shall be disappointed;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.65.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>behold, my servants shall sing for joy of heart, but you shall cry for sorrow of heart, and shall wail for anguish of spirit.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.65.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>You shall leave your name for a curse to my chosen; and the Lord Yahweh will kill you; and he will call his servants by another name:</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.65.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span>so that he who blesses himself in the earth shall bless himself in the God of truth; and he who swears in the earth shall swear by the God of truth; because the former troubles are forgotten, and because they are hidden from my eyes.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.65.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;For, behold, I create new heavens and a new earth; and the former things shall not be remembered, nor come into mind.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.65.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span>But be you glad and rejoice forever in that which I create; for, behold, I create Jerusalem a rejoicing, and her people a joy.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.65.19"><span class="verse-num">19&nbsp;</span>I will rejoice in Jerusalem, and joy in my people; and there shall be heard in her no more the voice of weeping and the voice of crying.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.65.20"><span class="verse-num">20&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;There shall be no more there an infant of days, nor an old man who has not filled his days; for the child shall die one hundred years old, and the sinner being one hundred years old shall be accursed.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.65.21"><span class="verse-num">21&nbsp;</span>They shall build houses, and inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, and eat their fruit.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.65.22"><span class="verse-num">22&nbsp;</span>They shall not build, and another inhabit; they shall not plant, and another eat: for as the days of a tree shall be the days of my people, and my chosen shall long enjoy the work of their hands.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.65.23"><span class="verse-num">23&nbsp;</span>They shall not labor in vain, nor give birth for calamity; for they are the seed of the blessed of Yahweh, and their offspring with them.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.65.24"><span class="verse-num">24&nbsp;</span>It shall happen that, before they call, I will answer; and while they are yet speaking, I will hear.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.65.25"><span class="verse-num">25&nbsp;</span>The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, and the lion shall eat straw like the ox; and dust shall be the serpent&rsquo;s food. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain,&rdquo; says Yahweh.</span>

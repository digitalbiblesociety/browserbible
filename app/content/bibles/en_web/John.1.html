<p>
<span class="verse John_1_19" data-osis="John.1.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>This is John&rsquo;s testimony, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo;</span>

<p>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_1_22" data-osis="John.1.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>They said therefore to him, &ldquo;Who are you? Give us an answer to take back to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_1_23" data-osis="John.1.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>He said, &ldquo;I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, &lsquo;Make straight the way of the Lord,&rsquo;<span class="cf">+<dfn>Isaiah 40:3</dfn></span> as Isaiah the prophet said.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_1_24" data-osis="John.1.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span>The ones who had been sent were from the Pharisees.</span>
<span class="verse John_1_25" data-osis="John.1.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span>They asked him, &ldquo;Why then do you baptize, if you are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the prophet?&rdquo;</span>

<p>
<span class="verse John_1_26" data-osis="John.1.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span>John answered them, &ldquo;I baptize in water, but among you stands one whom you don&rsquo;t know.</span>
<span class="verse John_1_27" data-osis="John.1.27"><span class="verse-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span>He is the one who comes after me, who is preferred before me, whose sandal strap I&rsquo;m not worthy to loosen.&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_1_29" data-osis="John.1.29"><span class="verse-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span>The next day, he saw Jesus coming to him, and said, &ldquo;Behold,<span class="note">+<dfn>&ldquo;Behold,&rdquo; from &ldquo;ἰδοὺ,&rdquo; means look at, take notice, observe, see, or gaze at. It is often used as an interjection.</dfn></span> the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!</span>
<span class="verse John_1_30" data-osis="John.1.30"><span class="verse-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span>This is he of whom I said, &lsquo;After me comes a man who is preferred before me, for he was before me.&rsquo;</span>
<span class="verse John_1_31" data-osis="John.1.31"><span class="verse-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span>I didn&rsquo;t know him, but for this reason I came baptizing in water: that he would be revealed to Israel.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse John_1_32" data-osis="John.1.32"><span class="verse-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span>John testified, saying, &ldquo;I have seen the Spirit descending like a dove out of heaven, and it remained on him.</span>
<span class="verse John_1_33" data-osis="John.1.33"><span class="verse-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span>I didn&rsquo;t recognize him, but he who sent me to baptize in water, he said to me, &lsquo;On whomever you will see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same is he who baptizes in the Holy Spirit.&rsquo;</span>
<span class="verse John_1_34" data-osis="John.1.34"><span class="verse-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span>I have seen, and have testified that this is the Son of God.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse John_1_36" data-osis="John.1.36"><span class="verse-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span>and he looked at Jesus as he walked, and said, &ldquo;Behold, the Lamb of God!&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse John_1_37" data-osis="John.1.37"><span class="verse-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span>The two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus.</span>

<span class="verse John_1_42" data-osis="John.1.42"><span class="verse-num v-42">42&nbsp;</span>He brought him to Jesus. Jesus looked at him, and said, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;You are Simon the son of Jonah. You shall be called Cephas&rdquo;</span> (which is by interpretation, Peter).</span>
<span class="verse John_1_43" data-osis="John.1.43"><span class="verse-num v-43">43&nbsp;</span>On the next day, he was determined to go out into Galilee, and he found Philip. Jesus said to him, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Follow me.&rdquo;</span></span>
<span class="verse John_1_44" data-osis="John.1.44"><span class="verse-num v-44">44&nbsp;</span>Now Philip was from Bethsaida, of the city of Andrew and Peter.</span>

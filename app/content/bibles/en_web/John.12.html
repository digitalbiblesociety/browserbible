<span class="verse" data-osis="John.12.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>Then six days before the Passover, Jesus came to Bethany, where Lazarus was, who had been dead, whom he raised from the dead.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.12.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>So they made him a supper there. Martha served, but Lazarus was one of those who sat at the table with him.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.12.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>Mary, therefore, took a pound<span class="note">+<dfn>a Roman pound of 12 ounces, or about 340 grams</dfn></span> of ointment of pure nard, very precious, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair. The house was filled with the fragrance of the ointment.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.12.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>Then Judas Iscariot, Simon&rsquo;s son, one of his disciples, who would betray him, said,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.12.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Why wasn&rsquo;t this ointment sold for three hundred denarii,<span class="note">+<dfn>300 denarii was about a year&rsquo;s wages for an agricultural laborer.</dfn></span> and given to the poor?&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.12.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>Now he said this, not because he cared for the poor, but because he was a thief, and having the money box, used to steal what was put into it.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.12.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>But Jesus said, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Leave her alone. She has kept this for the day of my burial. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.12.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> For you always have the poor with you, but you don&rsquo;t always have me.&rdquo;</span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="John.12.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>A large crowd therefore of the Jews learned that he was there, and they came, not for Jesus&rsquo; sake only, but that they might see Lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.12.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>But the chief priests conspired to put Lazarus to death also,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.12.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>because on account of him many of the Jews went away and believed in Jesus.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="John.12.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>On the next day a great multitude had come to the feast. When they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.12.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>they took the branches of the palm trees, and went out to meet him, and cried out, &ldquo;Hosanna<span class="note">+<dfn>&ldquo;Hosanna&rdquo; means &ldquo;save us&rdquo; or &ldquo;help us, we pray.&rdquo;</dfn></span>! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord,<span class="cf">+<dfn>Psalm 118:25-26</dfn></span> the King of Israel!&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="John.12.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>Jesus, having found a young donkey, sat on it. As it is written,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.12.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid, daughter of Zion. Behold, your King comes, sitting on a donkey&rsquo;s colt.&rdquo;<span class="cf">+<dfn>Zechariah 9:9</dfn></span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.12.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span>His disciples didn&rsquo;t understand these things at first, but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things were written about him, and that they had done these things to him.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.12.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span>The multitude therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of the tomb, and raised him from the dead, was testifying about it.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.12.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span>For this cause also the multitude went and met him, because they heard that he had done this sign.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.12.19"><span class="verse-num">19&nbsp;</span>The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, &ldquo;See how you accomplish nothing. Behold, the world has gone after him.&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="John.12.20"><span class="verse-num">20&nbsp;</span>Now there were certain Greeks among those that went up to worship at the feast.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.12.21"><span class="verse-num">21&nbsp;</span>These, therefore, came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida of Galilee, and asked him, saying, &ldquo;Sir, we want to see Jesus.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.12.22"><span class="verse-num">22&nbsp;</span>Philip came and told Andrew, and in turn, Andrew came with Philip, and they told Jesus.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.12.23"><span class="verse-num">23&nbsp;</span>Jesus answered them, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;The time has come for the Son of Man to be glorified. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.12.24"><span class="verse-num">24&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Most certainly I tell you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains by itself alone. But if it dies, it bears much fruit. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.12.25"><span class="verse-num">25&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> He who loves his life will lose it. He who hates his life in this world will keep it to eternal life. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.12.26"><span class="verse-num">26&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> If anyone serves me, let him follow me. Where I am, there will my servant also be. If anyone serves me, the Father will honor him.</span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="John.12.27"><span class="verse-num">27&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;Now my soul is troubled. What shall I say? &lsquo;Father, save me from this time?&rsquo; But for this cause I came to this time. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.12.28"><span class="verse-num">28&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Father, glorify your name!&rdquo;</span></span>

</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="John.12.29"><span class="verse-num">29&nbsp;</span>The multitude therefore, who stood by and heard it, said that it had thundered. Others said, &ldquo;An angel has spoken to him.&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="John.12.30"><span class="verse-num">30&nbsp;</span>Jesus answered, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;This voice hasn&rsquo;t come for my sake, but for your sakes. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.12.31"><span class="verse-num">31&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Now is the judgment of this world. Now the prince of this world will be cast out. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.12.32"><span class="verse-num">32&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> And I, if I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all people to myself.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.12.33"><span class="verse-num">33&nbsp;</span>But he said this, signifying by what kind of death he should die.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.12.34"><span class="verse-num">34&nbsp;</span>The multitude answered him, &ldquo;We have heard out of the law that the Christ remains forever.<span class="cf">+<dfn>Isaiah 9:7; Daniel 2:44 (but see also Isaiah 53:8)</dfn></span> How do you say, <span class="woc"> &lsquo;The Son of Man must be lifted up?&rsquo;</span> Who is this Son of Man?&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="John.12.35"><span class="verse-num">35&nbsp;</span>Jesus therefore said to them, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Yet a little while the light is with you. Walk while you have the light, that darkness doesn&rsquo;t overtake you. He who walks in the darkness doesn&rsquo;t know where he is going. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.12.36"><span class="verse-num">36&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> While you have the light, believe in the light, that you may become children of light.&rdquo;</span> Jesus said these things, and he departed and hid himself from them.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.12.37"><span class="verse-num">37&nbsp;</span>But though he had done so many signs before them, yet they didn&rsquo;t believe in him,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.12.38"><span class="verse-num">38&nbsp;</span>that the word of Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spoke,</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="John.12.39"><span class="verse-num">39&nbsp;</span>For this cause they couldn&rsquo;t believe, for Isaiah said again,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.12.40"><span class="verse-num">40&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;He has blinded their eyes and he hardened their heart,</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="John.12.41"><span class="verse-num">41&nbsp;</span>Isaiah said these things when he saw his glory, and spoke of him.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.12.42"><span class="verse-num">42&nbsp;</span>Nevertheless even of the rulers many believed in him, but because of the Pharisees they didn&rsquo;t confess it, so that they wouldn&rsquo;t be put out of the synagogue,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.12.43"><span class="verse-num">43&nbsp;</span>for they loved men&rsquo;s praise more than God&rsquo;s praise.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="John.12.44"><span class="verse-num">44&nbsp;</span>Jesus cried out and said, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Whoever believes in me, believes not in me, but in him who sent me. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.12.45"><span class="verse-num">45&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> He who sees me sees him who sent me. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.12.46"><span class="verse-num">46&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> I have come as a light into the world, that whoever believes in me may not remain in the darkness. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.12.47"><span class="verse-num">47&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> If anyone listens to my sayings, and doesn&rsquo;t believe, I don&rsquo;t judge him. For I came not to judge the world, but to save the world. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.12.48"><span class="verse-num">48&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> He who rejects me, and doesn&rsquo;t receive my sayings, has one who judges him. The word that I spoke, the same will judge him in the last day. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.12.49"><span class="verse-num">49&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> For I spoke not from myself, but the Father who sent me, he gave me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.12.50"><span class="verse-num">50&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> I know that his commandment is eternal life. The things therefore which I speak, even as the Father has said to me, so I speak.&rdquo;</span></span>

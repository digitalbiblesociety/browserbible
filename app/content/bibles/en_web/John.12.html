<span class="verse John_12_1" data-osis="John.12.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>Then six days before the Passover, Jesus came to Bethany, where Lazarus was, who had been dead, whom he raised from the dead.</span>
<span class="verse John_12_2" data-osis="John.12.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>So they made him a supper there. Martha served, but Lazarus was one of those who sat at the table with him.</span>
<span class="verse John_12_3" data-osis="John.12.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>Mary, therefore, took a pound<span class="note"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">a Roman pound of 12 ounces, or about 340 grams</span></span>  of ointment of pure nard, very precious, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair. The house was filled with the fragrance of the ointment.</span>
<span class="verse John_12_4" data-osis="John.12.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>Then Judas Iscariot, Simon&rsquo;s son, one of his disciples, who would betray him, said,</span>
<span class="verse John_12_5" data-osis="John.12.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Why wasn&rsquo;t this ointment sold for three hundred denarii,<span class="note"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">300 denarii was about a year&rsquo;s wages for an agricultural laborer.</span></span>  and given to the poor?&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse John_12_6" data-osis="John.12.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>Now he said this, not because he cared for the poor, but because he was a thief, and having the money box, used to steal what was put into it.</span>
<span class="verse John_12_7" data-osis="John.12.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>But Jesus said, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Leave her alone. She has kept this for the day of my burial. </span></span>
<span class="verse John_12_8" data-osis="John.12.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> For you always have the poor with you, but you don&rsquo;t always have me.&rdquo;</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_12_9" data-osis="John.12.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>A large crowd therefore of the Jews learned that he was there, and they came, not for Jesus&rsquo; sake only, but that they might see Lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead.</span>
<span class="verse John_12_10" data-osis="John.12.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>But the chief priests conspired to put Lazarus to death also,</span>
<span class="verse John_12_11" data-osis="John.12.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>because on account of him many of the Jews went away and believed in Jesus.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_12_12" data-osis="John.12.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>On the next day a great multitude had come to the feast. When they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,</span>
<span class="verse John_12_13" data-osis="John.12.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>they took the branches of the palm trees, and went out to meet him, and cried out, &ldquo;Hosanna<span class="note"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">&ldquo;Hosanna&rdquo; means &ldquo;save us&rdquo; or &ldquo;help us, we pray.&rdquo;</span></span> !

<span class="verse John_12_16" data-osis="John.12.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>His disciples didn&rsquo;t understand these things at first, but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things were written about him, and that they had done these things to him.</span>
<span class="verse John_12_17" data-osis="John.12.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>The multitude therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of the tomb, and raised him from the dead, was testifying about it.</span>
<span class="verse John_12_18" data-osis="John.12.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>For this cause also the multitude went and met him, because they heard that he had done this sign.</span>

<p>
<span class="verse John_12_39" data-osis="John.12.39"><span class="verse-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span>For this cause they couldn&rsquo;t believe, for Isaiah said again,<br /></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.16.26"><span class="verse-num">26&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> In that day you will ask in my name; and I don&rsquo;t say to you, that I will pray to the Father for you, </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.16.27"><span class="verse-num">27&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> for the Father himself loves you, because you have loved me, and have believed that I came from God. </span></span>

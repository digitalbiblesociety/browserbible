<span class="verse John_20_2" data-osis="John.20.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>Therefore she ran and came to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved, and said to them, &ldquo;They have taken away the Lord out of the tomb, and we don&rsquo;t know where they have laid him!&rdquo;</span>

<p>
<span class="verse John_20_3" data-osis="John.20.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>Therefore Peter and the other disciple went out, and they went toward the tomb.</span>
<span class="verse John_20_4" data-osis="John.20.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>They both ran together. The other disciple outran Peter, and came to the tomb first.</span>
<span class="verse John_20_5" data-osis="John.20.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>Stooping and looking in, he saw the linen cloths lying, yet he didn&rsquo;t enter in.</span>
<span class="verse John_20_6" data-osis="John.20.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>Then Simon Peter came, following him, and entered into the tomb. He saw the linen cloths lying,</span>
<span class="verse John_20_7" data-osis="John.20.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>and the cloth that had been on his head, not lying with the linen cloths, but rolled up in a place by itself.</span>
<span class="verse John_20_8" data-osis="John.20.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>So then the other disciple who came first to the tomb also entered in, and he saw and believed.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.3.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>Now there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.3.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>The same came to him by night, and said to him, &ldquo;Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher come from God, for no one can do these signs that you do, unless God is with him.&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="John.3.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>Jesus answered him, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Most certainly, I tell you, unless one is born anew, </span><span class="note">+<dfn>The word translated &ldquo;anew&rdquo; here and in John 3:7 (anothen) also means &ldquo;again&rdquo; and &ldquo;from above&rdquo;.</dfn></span><span class="woc"> he can&rsquo;t see the Kingdom of God.&rdquo;</span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="John.3.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>Nicodemus said to him, &ldquo;How can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter a second time into his mother&rsquo;s womb, and be born?&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="John.3.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>Jesus answered, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Most certainly I tell you, unless one is born of water and spirit, he can&rsquo;t enter into the Kingdom of God! </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.3.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> That which is born of the flesh is flesh. That which is born of the Spirit is spirit. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.3.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Don&rsquo;t marvel that I said to you, &lsquo;You must be born anew.&rsquo; </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.3.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> The wind</span><span class="note">+<dfn>The same Greek word (pneuma) means wind, breath, and spirit.</dfn></span><span class="woc"> blows where it wants to, and you hear its sound, but don&rsquo;t know where it comes from and where it is going. So is everyone who is born of the Spirit.&rdquo;</span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="John.3.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>Nicodemus answered him, &ldquo;How can these things be?&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="John.3.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>Jesus answered him, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Are you the teacher of Israel, and don&rsquo;t understand these things? </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.3.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Most certainly I tell you, we speak that which we know, and testify of that which we have seen, and you don&rsquo;t receive our witness. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.3.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> If I told you earthly things and you don&rsquo;t believe, how will you believe if I tell you heavenly things? </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.3.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> No one has ascended into heaven, but he who descended out of heaven, the Son of Man, who is in heaven. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.3.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up, </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.3.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have eternal life. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.3.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> For God so loved the world, that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have eternal life. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.3.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> For God didn&rsquo;t send his Son into the world to judge the world, but that the world should be saved through him. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.3.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> He who believes in him is not judged. He who doesn&rsquo;t believe has been judged already, because he has not believed in the name of the one and only Son of God. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.3.19"><span class="verse-num">19&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> This is the judgment, that the light has come into the world, and men loved the darkness rather than the light; for their works were evil. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.3.20"><span class="verse-num">20&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> For everyone who does evil hates the light, and doesn&rsquo;t come to the light, lest his works would be exposed. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.3.21"><span class="verse-num">21&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> But he who does the truth comes to the light, that his works may be revealed, that they have been done in God.&rdquo;</span></span>

<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="John.3.22"><span class="verse-num">22&nbsp;</span>After these things, Jesus came with his disciples into the land of Judea. He stayed there with them, and baptized.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.3.23"><span class="verse-num">23&nbsp;</span>John also was baptizing in Enon near Salim, because there was much water there. They came, and were baptized.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.3.24"><span class="verse-num">24&nbsp;</span>For John was not yet thrown into prison.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.3.25"><span class="verse-num">25&nbsp;</span>There arose therefore a questioning on the part of John&rsquo;s disciples with some Jews about purification.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.3.26"><span class="verse-num">26&nbsp;</span>They came to John, and said to him, &ldquo;Rabbi, he who was with you beyond the Jordan, to whom you have testified, behold, the same baptizes, and everyone is coming to him.&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="John.3.27"><span class="verse-num">27&nbsp;</span>John answered, &ldquo;A man can receive nothing, unless it has been given him from heaven.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.3.28"><span class="verse-num">28&nbsp;</span>You yourselves testify that I said, &lsquo;I am not the Christ,&rsquo; but, &lsquo;I have been sent before him.&rsquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.3.29"><span class="verse-num">29&nbsp;</span>He who has the bride is the bridegroom; but the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices greatly because of the bridegroom&rsquo;s voice. This, my joy, therefore is made full.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.3.30"><span class="verse-num">30&nbsp;</span>He must increase, but I must decrease.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.3.31"><span class="verse-num">31&nbsp;</span>He who comes from above is above all. He who is from the earth belongs to the earth, and speaks of the earth. He who comes from heaven is above all.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.3.32"><span class="verse-num">32&nbsp;</span>What he has seen and heard, of that he testifies; and no one receives his witness.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.3.33"><span class="verse-num">33&nbsp;</span>He who has received his witness has set his seal to this, that God is true.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.3.34"><span class="verse-num">34&nbsp;</span>For he whom God has sent speaks the words of God; for God gives the Spirit without measure.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.3.35"><span class="verse-num">35&nbsp;</span>The Father loves the Son, and has given all things into his hand.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.3.36"><span class="verse-num">36&nbsp;</span>One who believes in the Son has eternal life, but one who disobeys</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.7.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>After these things, Jesus was walking in Galilee, for he wouldn&rsquo;t walk in Judea, because the Jews sought to kill him.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.7.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>Now the feast of the Jews, the Feast of Booths, was at hand.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.7.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>His brothers therefore said to him, &ldquo;Depart from here, and go into Judea, that your disciples also may see your works which you do.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.7.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>For no one does anything in secret, and himself seeks to be known openly. If you do these things, reveal yourself to the world.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.7.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>For even his brothers didn&rsquo;t believe in him.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="John.7.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>Jesus therefore said to them, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;My time has not yet come, but your time is always ready. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.7.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> The world can&rsquo;t hate you, but it hates me, because I testify about it, that its works are evil. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.7.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> You go up to the feast. I am not yet going up to this feast, because my time is not yet fulfilled.&rdquo;</span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="John.7.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>Having said these things to them, he stayed in Galilee.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.7.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>But when his brothers had gone up to the feast, then he also went up, not publicly, but as it were in secret.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.7.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>The Jews therefore sought him at the feast, and said, &ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.7.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>There was much murmuring among the multitudes concerning him. Some said, &ldquo;He is a good man.&rdquo; Others said, &ldquo;Not so, but he leads the multitude astray.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.7.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>Yet no one spoke openly of him for fear of the Jews.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.7.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>But when it was now the midst of the feast, Jesus went up into the temple and taught.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.7.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>The Jews therefore marveled, saying, &ldquo;How does this man know letters, having never been educated?&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="John.7.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span>Jesus therefore answered them, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;My teaching is not mine, but his who sent me. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.7.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> If anyone desires to do his will, he will know about the teaching, whether it is from God, or if I am speaking from myself. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.7.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> He who speaks from himself seeks his own glory, but he who seeks the glory of him who sent him is true, and no unrighteousness is in him. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.7.19"><span class="verse-num">19&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Didn&rsquo;t Moses give you the law, and yet none of you keeps the law? Why do you seek to kill me?&rdquo;</span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="John.7.20"><span class="verse-num">20&nbsp;</span>The multitude answered, &ldquo;You have a demon! Who seeks to kill you?&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="John.7.21"><span class="verse-num">21&nbsp;</span>Jesus answered them, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;I did one work, and you all marvel because of it. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.7.22"><span class="verse-num">22&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Moses has given you circumcision (not that it is of Moses, but of the fathers), and on the Sabbath you circumcise a boy. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.7.23"><span class="verse-num">23&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> If a boy receives circumcision on the Sabbath, that the law of Moses may not be broken, are you angry with me, because I made a man completely healthy on the Sabbath? </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.7.24"><span class="verse-num">24&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Don&rsquo;t judge according to appearance, but judge righteous judgment.&rdquo; </span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="John.7.25"><span class="verse-num">25&nbsp;</span>Therefore some of them of Jerusalem said, &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t this he whom they seek to kill?</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.7.26"><span class="verse-num">26&nbsp;</span>Behold, he speaks openly, and they say nothing to him. Can it be that the rulers indeed know that this is truly the Christ?</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.7.27"><span class="verse-num">27&nbsp;</span>However we know where this man comes from, but when the Christ comes, no one will know where he comes from.&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="John.7.28"><span class="verse-num">28&nbsp;</span>Jesus therefore cried out in the temple, teaching and saying, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;You both know me, and know where I am from. I have not come of myself, but he who sent me is true, whom you don&rsquo;t know. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.7.29"><span class="verse-num">29&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> I know him, because I am from him, and he sent me.&rdquo;</span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="John.7.30"><span class="verse-num">30&nbsp;</span>They sought therefore to take him; but no one laid a hand on him, because his hour had not yet come.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.7.31"><span class="verse-num">31&nbsp;</span>But of the multitude, many believed in him. They said, &ldquo;When the Christ comes, he won&rsquo;t do more signs than those which this man has done, will he?&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.7.32"><span class="verse-num">32&nbsp;</span>The Pharisees heard the multitude murmuring these things concerning him, and the chief priests and the Pharisees sent officers to arrest him.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="John.7.33"><span class="verse-num">33&nbsp;</span>Then Jesus said, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;I will be with you a little while longer, then I go to him who sent me. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.7.34"><span class="verse-num">34&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> You will seek me, and won&rsquo;t find me; and where I am, you can&rsquo;t come.&rdquo;</span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="John.7.35"><span class="verse-num">35&nbsp;</span>The Jews therefore said among themselves, &ldquo;Where will this man go that we won&rsquo;t find him? Will he go to the Dispersion among the Greeks, and teach the Greeks?</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.7.36"><span class="verse-num">36&nbsp;</span>What is this word that he said, <span class="woc"> &lsquo;You will seek me, and won&rsquo;t find me; and where I am, you can&rsquo;t come&rsquo;?</span>&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="John.7.37"><span class="verse-num">37&nbsp;</span>Now on the last and greatest day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried out, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;If anyone is thirsty, let him come to me and drink! </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.7.38"><span class="verse-num">38&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> He who believes in me, as the Scripture has said, from within him will flow rivers of living water.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.7.39"><span class="verse-num">39&nbsp;</span>But he said this about the Spirit, which those believing in him were to receive. For the Holy Spirit was not yet given, because Jesus wasn&rsquo;t yet glorified.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="John.7.40"><span class="verse-num">40&nbsp;</span>Many of the multitude therefore, when they heard these words, said, &ldquo;This is truly the prophet.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.7.41"><span class="verse-num">41&nbsp;</span>Others said, &ldquo;This is the Christ.&rdquo; But some said, &ldquo;What, does the Christ come out of Galilee?</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.7.42"><span class="verse-num">42&nbsp;</span>Hasn&rsquo;t the Scripture said that the Christ comes of the seed of David,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.7.43"><span class="verse-num">43&nbsp;</span>So there arose a division in the multitude because of him.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.7.44"><span class="verse-num">44&nbsp;</span>Some of them would have arrested him, but no one laid hands on him.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.7.45"><span class="verse-num">45&nbsp;</span>The officers therefore came to the chief priests and Pharisees, and they said to them, &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you bring him?&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="John.7.46"><span class="verse-num">46&nbsp;</span>The officers answered, &ldquo;No man ever spoke like this man!&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="John.7.47"><span class="verse-num">47&nbsp;</span>The Pharisees therefore answered them, &ldquo;You aren&rsquo;t also led astray, are you?</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.7.48"><span class="verse-num">48&nbsp;</span>Have any of the rulers believed in him, or of the Pharisees?</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.7.49"><span class="verse-num">49&nbsp;</span>But this multitude that doesn&rsquo;t know the law is accursed.&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="John.7.50"><span class="verse-num">50&nbsp;</span>Nicodemus (he who came to him by night, being one of them) said to them,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.7.51"><span class="verse-num">51&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Does our law judge a man, unless it first hears from him personally and knows what he does?&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="John.7.52"><span class="verse-num">52&nbsp;</span>They answered him, &ldquo;Are you also from Galilee? Search, and see that no prophet has arisen out of Galilee.<span class="cf">+<dfn>See Isaiah 9:1 and Matthew 4:13-16.</dfn></span>&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="John.7.53"><span class="verse-num">53&nbsp;</span>Everyone went to his own house,</span>

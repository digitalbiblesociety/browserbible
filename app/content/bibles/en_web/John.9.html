</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_9_1" data-osis="John.9.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>As he passed by, he saw a man blind from birth.</span>
<span class="verse John_9_2" data-osis="John.9.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>His disciples asked him, &ldquo;Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_9_3" data-osis="John.9.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>Jesus answered, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Neither did this man sin, nor his parents; but, that the works of God might be revealed in him. </span></span>
<span class="verse John_9_4" data-osis="John.9.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> I must work the works of him who sent me, while it is day. The night is coming, when no one can work. </span></span>
<span class="verse John_9_5" data-osis="John.9.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> While I am in the world, I am the light of the world.&rdquo;</span></span>
<span class="verse John_9_6" data-osis="John.9.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>When he had said this, he spat on the ground, made mud with the saliva, anointed the blind man&rsquo;s eyes with the mud,</span>
<span class="verse John_9_7" data-osis="John.9.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>and said to him, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Go, wash in the pool of Siloam&rdquo;</span> (which means &ldquo;Sent&rdquo;). So he went away, washed, and came back seeing.</span>
<span class="verse John_9_8" data-osis="John.9.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>The neighbors therefore, and those who saw that he was blind before, said, &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t this he who sat and begged?&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse John_9_9" data-osis="John.9.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>Others were saying, &ldquo;It is he.&rdquo; Still others were saying, &ldquo;He looks like him.&rdquo;<br>He said, “I am he.”</span>
<span class="verse John_9_10" data-osis="John.9.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>They therefore were asking him, &ldquo;How were your eyes opened?&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_9_11" data-osis="John.9.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>He answered, &ldquo;A man called Jesus made mud, anointed my eyes, and said to me, <span class="woc"> &lsquo;Go to the pool of Siloam, and wash.&rsquo;</span> So I went away and washed, and I received sight.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_9_12" data-osis="John.9.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>Then they asked him, &ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo;<br>He said, “I don’t know.”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_9_13" data-osis="John.9.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>They brought him who had been blind to the Pharisees.</span>
<span class="verse John_9_14" data-osis="John.9.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>It was a Sabbath when Jesus made the mud and opened his eyes.</span>
<span class="verse John_9_15" data-osis="John.9.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>Again therefore the Pharisees also asked him how he received his sight. He said to them, &ldquo;He put mud on my eyes, I washed, and I see.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_9_16" data-osis="John.9.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>Some therefore of the Pharisees said, &ldquo;This man is not from God, because he doesn&rsquo;t keep the Sabbath.&rdquo; Others said, &ldquo;How can a man who is a sinner do such signs?&rdquo; There was division among them.</span>
<span class="verse John_9_17" data-osis="John.9.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>Therefore they asked the blind man again, &ldquo;What do you say about him, because he opened your eyes?&rdquo;<br>He said, “He is a prophet.”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_9_18" data-osis="John.9.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>The Jews therefore did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and had received his sight, until they called the parents of him who had received his sight,</span>
<span class="verse John_9_19" data-osis="John.9.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>and asked them, &ldquo;Is this your son, whom you say was born blind? How then does he now see?&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_9_20" data-osis="John.9.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>His parents answered them, &ldquo;We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind;</span>
<span class="verse John_9_21" data-osis="John.9.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>but how he now sees, we don&rsquo;t know; or who opened his eyes, we don&rsquo;t know. He is of age. Ask him. He will speak for himself.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse John_9_22" data-osis="John.9.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>His parents said these things because they feared the Jews; for the Jews had already agreed that if any man would confess him as Christ, he would be put out of the synagogue.</span>
<span class="verse John_9_23" data-osis="John.9.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>Therefore his parents said, &ldquo;He is of age. Ask him.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_9_24" data-osis="John.9.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span>So they called the man who was blind a second time, and said to him, &ldquo;Give glory to God. We know that this man is a sinner.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_9_25" data-osis="John.9.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span>He therefore answered, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if he is a sinner. One thing I do know: that though I was blind, now I see.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_9_26" data-osis="John.9.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span>They said to him again, &ldquo;What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_9_27" data-osis="John.9.27"><span class="verse-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span>He answered them, &ldquo;I told you already, and you didn&rsquo;t listen. Why do you want to hear it again? You don&rsquo;t also want to become his disciples, do you?&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_9_28" data-osis="John.9.28"><span class="verse-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span>They insulted him and said, &ldquo;You are his disciple, but we are disciples of Moses.</span>
<span class="verse John_9_29" data-osis="John.9.29"><span class="verse-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span>We know that God has spoken to Moses. But as for this man, we don&rsquo;t know where he comes from.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_9_30" data-osis="John.9.30"><span class="verse-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span>The man answered them, &ldquo;How amazing! You don&rsquo;t know where he comes from, yet he opened my eyes.</span>
<span class="verse John_9_31" data-osis="John.9.31"><span class="verse-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span>We know that God doesn&rsquo;t listen to sinners, but if anyone is a worshiper of God, and does his will, he listens to him.<span class="cf"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">Psalm 66:18, Proverbs 15:29; 28:9</span></span> </span>
<span class="verse John_9_32" data-osis="John.9.32"><span class="verse-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span>Since the world began it has never been heard of that anyone opened the eyes of someone born blind.</span>
<span class="verse John_9_33" data-osis="John.9.33"><span class="verse-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span>If this man were not from God, he could do nothing.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_9_34" data-osis="John.9.34"><span class="verse-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span>They answered him, &ldquo;You were altogether born in sins, and do you teach us?&rdquo; They threw him out.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_9_35" data-osis="John.9.35"><span class="verse-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span>Jesus heard that they had thrown him out, and finding him, he said, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Do you believe in the Son of God?&rdquo;</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_9_36" data-osis="John.9.36"><span class="verse-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span>He answered, &ldquo;Who is he, Lord, that I may believe in him?&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_9_37" data-osis="John.9.37"><span class="verse-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span>Jesus said to him, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;You have both seen him, and it is he who speaks with you.&rdquo;</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_9_38" data-osis="John.9.38"><span class="verse-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span>He said, &ldquo;Lord, I believe!&rdquo; and he worshiped him.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_9_39" data-osis="John.9.39"><span class="verse-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span>Jesus said, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;I came into this world for judgment, that those who don&rsquo;t see may see; and that those who see may become blind.&rdquo;</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_9_40" data-osis="John.9.40"><span class="verse-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span>Those of the Pharisees who were with him heard these things, and said to him, &ldquo;Are we also blind?&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_9_41" data-osis="John.9.41"><span class="verse-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span>Jesus said to them, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;If you were blind, you would have no sin; but now you say, &lsquo;We see.&rsquo; Therefore your sin remains.</span></span>

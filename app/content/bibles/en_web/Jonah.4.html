<span class="verse Jonah_4_1" data-osis="Jonah.4.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>But it displeased Jonah exceedingly, and he was angry.</span>
<span class="verse Jonah_4_2" data-osis="Jonah.4.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>He prayed to Yahweh, and said, &ldquo;Please, Yahweh, wasn&rsquo;t this what I said when I was still in my own country? Therefore I hurried to flee to Tarshish, for I knew that you are a gracious God, and merciful, slow to anger, and abundant in loving kindness, and you relent of doing harm.</span>
<span class="verse Jonah_4_3" data-osis="Jonah.4.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>Therefore now, Yahweh, take, I beg you, my life from me; for it is better for me to die than to live.&rdquo;</span>

<p>
<span class="verse Jonah_4_4" data-osis="Jonah.4.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>Yahweh said, &ldquo;Is it right for you to be angry?&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Jonah_4_5" data-osis="Jonah.4.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>Then Jonah went out of the city, and sat on the east side of the city, and there made himself a booth, and sat under it in the shade, until he might see what would become of the city.</span>
<span class="verse Jonah_4_6" data-osis="Jonah.4.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>Yahweh God prepared a vine, and made it to come up over Jonah, that it might be a shade over his head, to deliver him from his discomfort. So Jonah was exceedingly glad because of the vine.</span>
<span class="verse Jonah_4_7" data-osis="Jonah.4.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>But God prepared a worm at dawn the next day, and it chewed on the vine, so that it withered.</span>
<span class="verse Jonah_4_8" data-osis="Jonah.4.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>It happened, when the sun arose, that God prepared a sultry east wind; and the sun beat on Jonah&rsquo;s head, so that he fainted, and requested for himself that he might die, and said, &ldquo;It is better for me to die than to live.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Jonah_4_9" data-osis="Jonah.4.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>God said to Jonah, &ldquo;Is it right for you to be angry about the vine?&rdquo;<br>He said, “I am right to be angry, even to death.”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Jonah_4_10" data-osis="Jonah.4.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>Yahweh said, &ldquo;You have been concerned for the vine, for which you have not labored, neither made it grow; which came up in a night, and perished in a night.</span>
<span class="verse Jonah_4_11" data-osis="Jonah.4.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>Shouldn&rsquo;t I be concerned for Nineveh, that great city, in which are more than one hundred twenty thousand persons who can&rsquo;t discern between their right hand and their left hand; and also much livestock?&rdquo;</span>

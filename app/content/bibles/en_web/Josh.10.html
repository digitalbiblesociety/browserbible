</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Josh_10_1" data-osis="Josh.10.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>Now it happened when Adoni-Zedek king of Jerusalem heard how Joshua had taken Ai, and had utterly destroyed it; as he had done to Jericho and her king, so he had done to Ai and her king; and how the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel, and were among them;</span>
<span class="verse Josh_10_2" data-osis="Josh.10.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>that they were very afraid, because Gibeon was a great city, as one of the royal cities, and because it was greater than Ai, and all its men were mighty.</span>
<span class="verse Josh_10_3" data-osis="Josh.10.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>Therefore Adoni-Zedek king of Jerusalem sent to Hoham king of Hebron, to Piram king of Jarmuth, to Japhia king of Lachish, and to Debir king of Eglon, saying,</span>
<span class="verse Josh_10_4" data-osis="Josh.10.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Come up to me, and help me, and let us strike Gibeon; for it has made peace with Joshua and with the children of Israel.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Josh_10_5" data-osis="Josh.10.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>Therefore the five kings of the Amorites, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king of Eglon, gathered themselves together, and went up, they and all their armies, and encamped against Gibeon, and made war against it.</span>
<span class="verse Josh_10_6" data-osis="Josh.10.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>The men of Gibeon sent to Joshua to the camp to Gilgal, saying, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t abandon your servants! Come up to us quickly, and save us, and help us; for all the kings of the Amorites that dwell in the hill country have gathered together against us.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Josh_10_7" data-osis="Josh.10.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>So Joshua went up from Gilgal, he, and all the people of war with him, and all the mighty men of valor.</span>
<span class="verse Josh_10_8" data-osis="Josh.10.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>Yahweh said to Joshua, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t fear them, for I have delivered them into your hands. Not a man of them will stand before you.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Josh_10_9" data-osis="Josh.10.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>Joshua therefore came on them suddenly. He went up from Gilgal all night.</span>
<span class="verse Josh_10_10" data-osis="Josh.10.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>Yahweh confused them before Israel, and he killed them with a great slaughter at Gibeon, and chased them by the way of the ascent of Beth Horon, and struck them to Azekah and to Makkedah.</span>
<span class="verse Josh_10_11" data-osis="Josh.10.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>It happened, as they fled from before Israel, while they were at the descent of Beth Horon, that Yahweh cast down great stones from the sky on them to Azekah, and they died. There were more who died from the hailstones than who the children of Israel killed with the sword.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Josh_10_12" data-osis="Josh.10.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>Then Joshua spoke to Yahweh in the day when Yahweh delivered up the Amorites before the children of Israel; and he said in the sight of Israel, &ldquo;Sun, stand still on Gibeon! You, moon, stop in the valley of Aijalon!&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Josh_10_13" data-osis="Josh.10.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>The sun stood still, and the moon stayed, until the nation had avenged themselves of their enemies. Isn&rsquo;t this written in the book of Jashar? The sun stayed in the midst of the sky, and didn&rsquo;t hurry to go down about a whole day.</span>
<span class="verse Josh_10_14" data-osis="Josh.10.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>There was no day like that before it or after it, that Yahweh listened to the voice of a man; for Yahweh fought for Israel.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Josh_10_15" data-osis="Josh.10.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to the camp to Gilgal.</span>
<span class="verse Josh_10_16" data-osis="Josh.10.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>These five kings fled, and hid themselves in the cave at Makkedah.</span>
<span class="verse Josh_10_17" data-osis="Josh.10.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>Joshua was told, saying, &ldquo;The five kings are found, hidden in the cave at Makkedah.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Josh_10_18" data-osis="Josh.10.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>Joshua said, &ldquo;Roll large stones to the mouth of the cave, and set men by it to guard them;</span>
<span class="verse Josh_10_19" data-osis="Josh.10.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>but don&rsquo;t stay. Pursue your enemies, and them from the rear. Don&rsquo;t allow them to enter into their cities; for Yahweh your God has delivered them into your hand.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Josh_10_20" data-osis="Josh.10.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>It happened, when Joshua and the children of Israel had finished killing them with a very great slaughter until they were consumed, and the remnant which remained of them had entered into the fortified cities,</span>
<span class="verse Josh_10_21" data-osis="Josh.10.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>that all the people returned to the camp to Joshua at Makkedah in peace. None moved his tongue against any of the children of Israel.</span>
<span class="verse Josh_10_22" data-osis="Josh.10.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>Then Joshua said, &ldquo;Open the mouth of the cave, and bring those five kings out of the cave to me.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Josh_10_23" data-osis="Josh.10.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>They did so, and brought those five kings out of the cave to him: the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon.</span>
<span class="verse Josh_10_24" data-osis="Josh.10.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span>It happened, when they brought those kings out to Joshua, that Joshua called for all the men of Israel, and said to the chiefs of the men of war who went with him, &ldquo;Come near, put your feet on the necks of these kings.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Josh_10_25" data-osis="Josh.10.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span>Joshua said to them, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid, nor be dismayed. Be strong and courageous, for Yahweh will do this to all your enemies against whom you fight.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Josh_10_26" data-osis="Josh.10.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span>Afterward Joshua struck them, put them to death, and hanged them on five trees. They were hanging on the trees until the evening.</span>
<span class="verse Josh_10_27" data-osis="Josh.10.27"><span class="verse-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span>It happened at the time of the going down of the sun, that Joshua commanded, and they took them down off the trees, and cast them into the cave in which they had hidden themselves, and laid great stones on the mouth of the cave, which remain to this very day.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Josh_10_28" data-osis="Josh.10.28"><span class="verse-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span>Joshua took Makkedah on that day, and struck it with the edge of the sword, with its king. He utterly destroyed them and all the souls who were in it. He left no one remaining. He did to the king of Makkedah as he had done to the king of Jericho.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Josh_10_29" data-osis="Josh.10.29"><span class="verse-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span>Joshua passed from Makkedah, and all Israel with him, to Libnah, and fought against Libnah.</span>
<span class="verse Josh_10_30" data-osis="Josh.10.30"><span class="verse-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span>Yahweh delivered it also, with its king, into the hand of Israel. He struck it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls who were in it. He left no one remaining in it. He did to its king as he had done to the king of Jericho.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Josh_10_31" data-osis="Josh.10.31"><span class="verse-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span>Joshua passed from Libnah, and all Israel with him, to Lachish, and encamped against it, and fought against it.</span>
<span class="verse Josh_10_32" data-osis="Josh.10.32"><span class="verse-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span>Yahweh delivered Lachish into the hand of Israel. He took it on the second day, and struck it with the edge of the sword, with all the souls who were in it, according to all that he had done to Libnah.</span>
<span class="verse Josh_10_33" data-osis="Josh.10.33"><span class="verse-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span>Then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish; and Joshua struck him and his people, until he had left him no one remaining.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Josh_10_34" data-osis="Josh.10.34"><span class="verse-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span>Joshua passed from Lachish, and all Israel with him, to Eglon; and they encamped against it fought against it.</span>
<span class="verse Josh_10_35" data-osis="Josh.10.35"><span class="verse-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span>They took it on that day, and struck it with the edge of the sword. He utterly destroyed all the souls who were in it that day, according to all that he had done to Lachish.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Josh_10_36" data-osis="Josh.10.36"><span class="verse-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span>Joshua went up from Eglon, and all Israel with him, to Hebron; and they fought against it.</span>
<span class="verse Josh_10_37" data-osis="Josh.10.37"><span class="verse-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span>They took it, and struck it with the edge of the sword, with its king and all its cities, and all the souls who were in it. He left no one remaining, according to all that he had done to Eglon; but he utterly destroyed it, and all the souls who were in it.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Josh_10_38" data-osis="Josh.10.38"><span class="verse-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span>Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to Debir, and fought against it.</span>
<span class="verse Josh_10_39" data-osis="Josh.10.39"><span class="verse-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span>He took it, with its king and all its cities. They struck them with the edge of the sword, and utterly destroyed all the souls who were in it. He left no one remaining.

<span class="verse Josh_10_40" data-osis="Josh.10.40"><span class="verse-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span>So Joshua struck all the land, the hill country, and the South, and the lowland, and the slopes, and all their kings.

<span class="verse Josh_10_41" data-osis="Josh.10.41"><span class="verse-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span>Joshua struck them from Kadesh Barnea even to Gaza, and all the country of Goshen, even to Gibeon.</span>

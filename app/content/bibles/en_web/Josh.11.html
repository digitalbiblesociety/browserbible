<span class="verse Josh_11_1" data-osis="Josh.11.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>It happened, when Jabin king of Hazor heard of it, that he sent to Jobab king of Madon, to the king of Shimron, to the king of Achshaph,</span>
<span class="verse Josh_11_2" data-osis="Josh.11.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>and to the kings who were on the north, in the hill country, in the Arabah south of Chinneroth, in the lowland, and in the heights of Dor on the west,</span>
<span class="verse Josh_11_3" data-osis="Josh.11.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>to the Canaanite on the east and on the west, and the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Jebusite in the hill country, and the Hivite under Hermon in the land of Mizpah.</span>
<span class="verse Josh_11_4" data-osis="Josh.11.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>They went out, they and all their armies with them, many people, even as the sand that is on the seashore in multitude, with very many horses and chariots.</span>
<span class="verse Josh_11_5" data-osis="Josh.11.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>All these kings met together; and they came and encamped together at the waters of Merom, to fight with Israel.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Josh_11_6" data-osis="Josh.11.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>Yahweh said to Joshua, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid because of them; for tomorrow at this time, I will deliver them up all slain before Israel. You shall hamstring their horses and burn their chariots with fire.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Josh_11_7" data-osis="Josh.11.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>So Joshua came, and all the people of war with him, against them by the waters of Merom suddenly, and fell on them.</span>
<span class="verse Josh_11_8" data-osis="Josh.11.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>Yahweh delivered them into the hand of Israel, and they struck them, and chased them to great Sidon, and to Misrephoth Maim, and to the valley of Mizpeh eastward. They struck them until they left them no one remaining.</span>
<span class="verse Josh_11_9" data-osis="Josh.11.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>Joshua did to them as Yahweh told him. He hamstrung their horses and burnt their chariots with fire.</span>
<span class="verse Josh_11_10" data-osis="Josh.11.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>Joshua turned back at that time, and took Hazor, and struck its king with the sword: for Hazor used to be the head of all those kingdoms.</span>
<span class="verse Josh_11_11" data-osis="Josh.11.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>They struck all the souls who were in it with the edge of the sword, utterly destroying them. There was no one left who breathed. He burnt Hazor with fire.</span>
<span class="verse Josh_11_12" data-osis="Josh.11.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>Joshua captured all the cities of those kings, with their kings, and he struck them with the edge of the sword, and utterly destroyed them; as Moses the servant of Yahweh commanded.</span>
<span class="verse Josh_11_13" data-osis="Josh.11.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>But as for the cities that stood on their mounds, Israel burned none of them, except Hazor only. Joshua burned that.</span>
<span class="verse Josh_11_14" data-osis="Josh.11.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>The children of Israel took all the plunder of these cities, with the livestock, as plunder for themselves; but every man they struck with the edge of the sword, until they had destroyed them. They didn&rsquo;t leave any who breathed.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Josh_11_15" data-osis="Josh.11.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>As Yahweh commanded Moses his servant, so Moses commanded Joshua. Joshua did so. He left nothing undone of all that Yahweh commanded Moses.</span>
<span class="verse Josh_11_16" data-osis="Josh.11.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>So Joshua captured all that land, the hill country, all the South, all the land of Goshen, the lowland, the Arabah, the hill country of Israel, and the lowland of the same;</span>
<span class="verse Josh_11_17" data-osis="Josh.11.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>from Mount Halak, that goes up to Seir, even to Baal Gad in the valley of Lebanon under Mount Hermon. He took all their kings, struck them, and put them to death.</span>
<span class="verse Josh_11_18" data-osis="Josh.11.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>Joshua made war a long time with all those kings.</span>
<span class="verse Josh_11_19" data-osis="Josh.11.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>There was not a city that made peace with the children of Israel, except the Hivites, the inhabitants of Gibeon. They took all in battle.</span>
<span class="verse Josh_11_20" data-osis="Josh.11.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>For it was of Yahweh to harden their hearts, to come against Israel in battle, that he might utterly destroy them, that they might have no favor, but that he might destroy them, as Yahweh commanded Moses.</span>
<span class="verse Josh_11_21" data-osis="Josh.11.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>Joshua came at that time, and cut off the Anakim from the hill country, from Hebron, from Debir, from Anab, and from all the hill country of Judah, and from all the hill country of Israel: Joshua utterly destroyed them with their cities.</span>
<span class="verse Josh_11_22" data-osis="Josh.11.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>There were none of the Anakim left in the land of the children of Israel. Only in Gaza, in Gath, and in Ashdod, did some remain.</span>
<span class="verse Josh_11_23" data-osis="Josh.11.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>So Joshua took the whole land, according to all that Yahweh spoke to Moses; and Joshua gave it for an inheritance to Israel according to their divisions by their tribes. The land had rest from war.</span>

<span class="verse Josh_17_1" data-osis="Josh.17.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>This was the lot for the tribe of Manasseh, for he was the firstborn of Joseph. As for Machir the firstborn of Manasseh, the father of Gilead, because he was a man of war, therefore he had Gilead and Bashan.</span>
<span class="verse Josh_17_2" data-osis="Josh.17.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>So this was for the rest of the children of Manasseh according to their families: for the children of Abiezer, for the children of Helek, for the children of Asriel, for the children of Shechem, for the children of Hepher, and for the children of Shemida: these were the male children of Manasseh the son of Joseph according to their families.</span>
<span class="verse Josh_17_3" data-osis="Josh.17.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>But Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, had no sons, but daughters: and these are the names of his daughters: Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah.</span>
<span class="verse Josh_17_4" data-osis="Josh.17.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>They came near before Eleazar the priest, and before Joshua the son of Nun, and before the princes, saying, &ldquo;Yahweh commanded Moses to give us an inheritance among our brothers.&rdquo; Therefore according to the commandment of Yahweh he gave them an inheritance among the brothers of their father.</span>
<span class="verse Josh_17_5" data-osis="Josh.17.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>Ten parts fell to Manasseh, besides the land of Gilead and Bashan, which is beyond the Jordan;</span>
<span class="verse Josh_17_6" data-osis="Josh.17.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>because the daughters of Manasseh had an inheritance among his sons. The land of Gilead belonged to the rest of the sons of Manasseh.</span>
<span class="verse Josh_17_7" data-osis="Josh.17.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>The border of Manasseh was from Asher to Michmethath, which is before Shechem. The border went along to the right hand, to the inhabitants of En Tappuah.</span>
<span class="verse Josh_17_8" data-osis="Josh.17.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>The land of Tappuah belonged to Manasseh; but Tappuah on the border of Manasseh belonged to the children of Ephraim.</span>
<span class="verse Josh_17_9" data-osis="Josh.17.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>The border went down to the brook of Kanah, southward of the brook. These cities belonged to Ephraim among the cities of Manasseh. The border of Manasseh was on the north side of the brook, and ended at the sea.</span>
<span class="verse Josh_17_10" data-osis="Josh.17.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>Southward it was Ephraim&rsquo;s, and northward it was Manasseh&rsquo;s, and the sea was his border. They reached to Asher on the north, and to Issachar on the east.</span>
<span class="verse Josh_17_11" data-osis="Josh.17.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>Manasseh had three heights in Issachar, in Asher Beth Shean and its towns, and Ibleam and its towns, and the inhabitants of Dor and its towns, and the inhabitants of Endor and its towns, and the inhabitants of Taanach and its towns, and the inhabitants of Megiddo and its towns.</span>
<span class="verse Josh_17_12" data-osis="Josh.17.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>Yet the children of Manasseh couldn&rsquo;t drive out the inhabitants of those cities; but the Canaanites would dwell in that land.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Josh_17_13" data-osis="Josh.17.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>It happened, when the children of Israel had grown strong, that they put the Canaanites to forced labor, and didn&rsquo;t utterly drive them out.</span>
<span class="verse Josh_17_14" data-osis="Josh.17.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>The children of Joseph spoke to Joshua, saying, &ldquo;Why have you given me just one lot and one part for an inheritance, since I am a great people, because Yahweh has blessed me so far?&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Josh_17_15" data-osis="Josh.17.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>Joshua said to them, &ldquo;If you are a great people, go up to the forest, and clear land for yourself there in the land of the Perizzites and of the Rephaim; since the hill country of Ephraim is too narrow for you.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Josh_17_16" data-osis="Josh.17.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>The children of Joseph said, &ldquo;The hill country is not enough for us. All the Canaanites who dwell in the land of the valley have chariots of iron, both those who are in Beth Shean and its towns, and those who are in the valley of Jezreel.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Josh_17_17" data-osis="Josh.17.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>Joshua spoke to the house of Joseph, even to Ephraim and to Manasseh, saying, &ldquo;You are a great people, and have great power. You shall not have one lot only;</span>
<span class="verse Josh_17_18" data-osis="Josh.17.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>but the hill country shall be yours. Although it is a forest, you shall cut it down, and it&rsquo;s farthest extent shall be yours; for you shall drive out the Canaanites, though they have chariots of iron, and though they are strong.&rdquo;</span>

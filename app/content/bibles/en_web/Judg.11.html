<span class="verse Judg_11_1" data-osis="Judg.11.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>Now Jephthah the Gileadite was a mighty man of valor, and he was the son of a prostitute: and Gilead became the father of Jephthah.</span>
<span class="verse Judg_11_2" data-osis="Judg.11.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>Gilead&rsquo;s wife bore him sons; and when his wife&rsquo;s sons grew up, they drove out Jephthah, and said to him, &ldquo;You shall not inherit in our father&rsquo;s house; for you are the son of another woman.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Judg_11_3" data-osis="Judg.11.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>Then Jephthah fled from his brothers, and lived in the land of Tob: and there were gathered vain fellows to Jephthah, and they went out with him.</span>
<span class="verse Judg_11_4" data-osis="Judg.11.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>It happened after a while, that the children of Ammon made war against Israel.</span>
<span class="verse Judg_11_5" data-osis="Judg.11.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>It was so, that when the children of Ammon made war against Israel, the elders of Gilead went to get Jephthah out of the land of Tob;</span>
<span class="verse Judg_11_6" data-osis="Judg.11.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>and they said to Jephthah, &ldquo;Come and be our chief, that we may fight with the children of Ammon.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Judg_11_7" data-osis="Judg.11.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead, &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you hate me, and drive me out of my father&rsquo;s house? Why have you come to me now when you are in distress?&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Judg_11_8" data-osis="Judg.11.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>The elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, &ldquo;Therefore we have turned again to you now, that you may go with us, and fight with the children of Ammon; and you shall be our head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Judg_11_9" data-osis="Judg.11.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead, &ldquo;If you bring me home again to fight with the children of Ammon, and Yahweh deliver them before me, shall I be your head?&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Judg_11_10" data-osis="Judg.11.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>The elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, &ldquo;Yahweh shall be witness between us; surely according to your word so will we do.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Judg_11_11" data-osis="Judg.11.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>Then Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and the people made him head and chief over them: and Jephthah spoke all his words before Yahweh in Mizpah.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Judg_11_12" data-osis="Judg.11.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>Jephthah sent messengers to the king of the children of Ammon, saying, &ldquo;What have you to do with me, that you have come to me to fight against my land?&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Judg_11_13" data-osis="Judg.11.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>The king of the children of Ammon answered to the messengers of Jephthah, &ldquo;Because Israel took away my land, when he came up out of Egypt, from the Arnon even to the Jabbok, and to the Jordan: now therefore restore that territory again peaceably.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Judg_11_14" data-osis="Judg.11.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>Jephthah sent messengers again to the king of the children of Ammon;</span>
<span class="verse Judg_11_15" data-osis="Judg.11.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>and he said to him, &ldquo;Thus says Jephthah: Israel didn&rsquo;t take away the land of Moab, nor the land of the children of Ammon,</span>
<span class="verse Judg_11_16" data-osis="Judg.11.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>but when they came up from Egypt, and Israel went through the wilderness to the Red Sea, and came to Kadesh;</span>
<span class="verse Judg_11_17" data-osis="Judg.11.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>then Israel sent messengers to the king of Edom, saying, &lsquo;Please let me pass through your land;&rsquo; but the king of Edom didn&rsquo;t listen. In the same way, he sent to the king of Moab; but he would not: and Israel stayed in Kadesh.</span>
<span class="verse Judg_11_18" data-osis="Judg.11.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>Then they went through the wilderness, and went around the land of Edom, and the land of Moab, and came by the east side of the land of Moab, and they encamped on the other side of the Arnon; but they didn&rsquo;t come within the border of Moab, for the Arnon was the border of Moab.</span>
<span class="verse Judg_11_19" data-osis="Judg.11.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, the king of Heshbon; and Israel said to him, &lsquo;Please let us pass through your land to my place.&rsquo;</span>
<span class="verse Judg_11_20" data-osis="Judg.11.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>But Sihon didn&rsquo;t trust Israel to pass through his border; but Sihon gathered all his people together, and encamped in Jahaz, and fought against Israel.</span>
<span class="verse Judg_11_21" data-osis="Judg.11.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>Yahweh, the God of Israel, delivered Sihon and all his people into the hand of Israel, and they struck them: so Israel possessed all the land of the Amorites, the inhabitants of that country.</span>
<span class="verse Judg_11_22" data-osis="Judg.11.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>They possessed all the border of the Amorites, from the Arnon even to the Jabbok, and from the wilderness even to the Jordan.</span>
<span class="verse Judg_11_23" data-osis="Judg.11.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>So now Yahweh, the God of Israel, has dispossessed the Amorites from before his people Israel, and should you possess them?</span>
<span class="verse Judg_11_24" data-osis="Judg.11.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span>Won&rsquo;t you possess that which Chemosh your god gives you to possess? So whoever Yahweh our God has dispossessed from before us, them will we possess.</span>
<span class="verse Judg_11_25" data-osis="Judg.11.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span>Now are you anything better than Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab? Did he ever strive against Israel, or did he ever fight against them?</span>
<span class="verse Judg_11_26" data-osis="Judg.11.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span>While Israel lived in Heshbon and its towns, and in Aroer and its towns, and in all the cities that are along by the side of the Arnon, three hundred years; why didn&rsquo;t you recover them within that time?</span>
<span class="verse Judg_11_27" data-osis="Judg.11.27"><span class="verse-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span>I therefore have not sinned against you, but you do me wrong to war against me. Yahweh, the Judge, be judge this day between the children of Israel and the children of Ammon.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Judg_11_28" data-osis="Judg.11.28"><span class="verse-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span>However the king of the children of Ammon didn&rsquo;t listen to the words of Jephthah which he sent him.</span>
<span class="verse Judg_11_29" data-osis="Judg.11.29"><span class="verse-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span>Then the Spirit of Yahweh came on Jephthah, and he passed over Gilead and Manasseh, and passed over Mizpeh of Gilead, and from Mizpeh of Gilead he passed over to the children of Ammon.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Judg_11_30" data-osis="Judg.11.30"><span class="verse-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span>Jephthah vowed a vow to Yahweh, and said, &ldquo;If you will indeed deliver the children of Ammon into my hand,</span>
<span class="verse Judg_11_31" data-osis="Judg.11.31"><span class="verse-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span>then it shall be, that whatever comes out of the doors of my house to meet me, when I return in peace from the children of Ammon, it shall be Yahweh&rsquo;s, and I will offer it up for a burnt offering.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Judg_11_32" data-osis="Judg.11.32"><span class="verse-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span>So Jephthah passed over to the children of Ammon to fight against them; and Yahweh delivered them into his hand.</span>
<span class="verse Judg_11_33" data-osis="Judg.11.33"><span class="verse-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span>He struck them from Aroer until you come to Minnith, even twenty cities, and to Abelcheramim, with a very great slaughter. So the children of Ammon were subdued before the children of Israel.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Judg_11_34" data-osis="Judg.11.34"><span class="verse-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span>Jephthah came to Mizpah to his house; and behold, his daughter came out to meet him with tambourines and with dances: and she was his only child; besides her he had neither son nor daughter.</span>
<span class="verse Judg_11_35" data-osis="Judg.11.35"><span class="verse-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span>It happened, when he saw her, that he tore his clothes, and said, &ldquo;Alas, my daughter! You have brought me very low, and you are one of those who trouble me; for I have opened my mouth to Yahweh, and I can&rsquo;t go back.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Judg_11_36" data-osis="Judg.11.36"><span class="verse-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span>She said to him, &ldquo;My father, you have opened your mouth to Yahweh; do to me according to that which has proceeded out of your mouth, because Yahweh has taken vengeance for you on your enemies, even on the children of Ammon.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Judg_11_37" data-osis="Judg.11.37"><span class="verse-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span>She said to her father, &ldquo;Let this thing be done for me: let me alone two months, that I may depart and go down on the mountains, and bewail my virginity, I and my companions.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Judg_11_38" data-osis="Judg.11.38"><span class="verse-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span>He said, &ldquo;Go.&rdquo; He sent her away for two months: and she departed, she and her companions, and mourned her virginity on the mountains.</span>
<span class="verse Judg_11_39" data-osis="Judg.11.39"><span class="verse-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span>It happened at the end of two months, that she returned to her father, who did with her according to his vow which he had vowed: and she was a virgin. It was a custom in Israel,</span>
<span class="verse Judg_11_40" data-osis="Judg.11.40"><span class="verse-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span>that the daughters of Israel went yearly to celebrate the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite four days in a year.</span>

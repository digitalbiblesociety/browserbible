<span class="verse" data-osis="Judg.14.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>Samson went down to Timnah, and saw a woman in Timnah of the daughters of the Philistines.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Judg.14.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>He came up, and told his father and his mother, and said, &ldquo;I have seen a woman in Timnah of the daughters of the Philistines: now therefore get her for me as wife.&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Judg.14.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>Then his father and his mother said to him, &ldquo;Is there never a woman among the daughters of your brothers, or among all my people, that you go to take a wife of the uncircumcised Philistines?&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Judg.14.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>But his father and his mother didn&rsquo;t know that it was of Yahweh; for he sought an occasion against the Philistines. Now at that time the Philistines had rule over Israel.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Judg.14.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>Then went Samson down, and his father and his mother, to Timnah, and came to the vineyards of Timnah: and behold, a young lion roared against him.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Judg.14.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>The Spirit of Yahweh came mightily on him, and he tore him as he would have torn a young goat; and he had nothing in his hand: but he didn&rsquo;t tell his father or his mother what he had done.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Judg.14.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>He went down, and talked with the woman, and she pleased Samson well.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Judg.14.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>After a while he returned to take her; and he turned aside to see the carcass of the lion: and behold, there was a swarm of bees in the body of the lion, and honey.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Judg.14.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>He took it into his hands, and went on, eating as he went; and he came to his father and mother, and gave to them, and they ate: but he didn&rsquo;t tell them that he had taken the honey out of the body of the lion.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Judg.14.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>His father went down to the woman: and Samson made there a feast; for so used the young men to do.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Judg.14.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>It happened, when they saw him, that they brought thirty companions to be with him.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Judg.14.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>Samson said to them, &ldquo;Let me tell you a riddle now. If you can declare it to me within the seven days of the feast, and find it out, then I will give you thirty linen garments and thirty changes of clothing;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Judg.14.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>but if you can&rsquo;t declare it to me, then you shall give me thirty linen garments and thirty changes of clothing.&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Judg.14.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>He said to them,</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Judg.14.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>It happened on the seventh day, that they said to Samson&rsquo;s wife, &ldquo;Entice your husband, that he may declare to us the riddle, lest we burn you and your father&rsquo;s house with fire. Have you called us to impoverish us? Is it not so?&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Judg.14.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span>Samson&rsquo;s wife wept before him, and said, &ldquo;You just hate me, and don&rsquo;t love me. You have told a riddle to the children of my people, and haven&rsquo;t told it to me.&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Judg.14.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span>She wept before him the seven days, while their feast lasted: and it happened on the seventh day, that he told her, because she pressed him severely; and she told the riddle to the children of her people.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Judg.14.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span>The men of the city said to him on the seventh day before the sun went down, &ldquo;What is sweeter than honey? What is stronger than a lion?&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Judg.14.19"><span class="verse-num">19&nbsp;</span>The Spirit of Yahweh came mightily on him, and he went down to Ashkelon, and struck thirty men of them, and took their plunder, and gave the changes of clothing to those who declared the riddle. His anger was kindled, and he went up to his father&rsquo;s house.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Judg.14.20"><span class="verse-num">20&nbsp;</span>But Samson&rsquo;s wife was given to his companion, whom he had used as his friend.</span>

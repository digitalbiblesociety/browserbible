<span class="verse" data-osis="Judg.17.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>There was a man of the hill country of Ephraim, whose name was Micah.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Judg.17.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>He said to his mother, &ldquo;The eleven hundred pieces of silver that were taken from you, about which you uttered a curse, and also spoke it in my ears, behold, the silver is with me; I took it.&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Judg.17.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>He restored the eleven hundred pieces of silver to his mother; and his mother said, &ldquo;I most certainly dedicate the silver to Yahweh from my hand for my son, to make an engraved image and a molten image. Now therefore I will restore it to you.&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Judg.17.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>When he restored the money to his mother, his mother took two hundred pieces of silver, and gave them to the founder, who made of it an engraved image and a molten image: and it was in the house of Micah.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Judg.17.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>The man Micah had a house of gods, and he made an ephod, and teraphim, and consecrated one of his sons, who became his priest.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Judg.17.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>In those days there was no king in Israel: every man did that which was right in his own eyes.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Judg.17.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>There was a young man out of Bethlehem Judah, of the family of Judah, who was a Levite; and he lived there.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Judg.17.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>The man departed out of the city, out of Bethlehem Judah, to live where he could find a place, and he came to the hill country of Ephraim to the house of Micah, as he traveled.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Judg.17.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>Micah said to him, &ldquo;Where did you come from?&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Judg.17.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>Micah said to him, &ldquo;Dwell with me, and be to me a father and a priest, and I will give you ten pieces of silver per year, a suit of clothing, and your food.&rdquo; So the Levite went in.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Judg.17.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>The Levite was content to dwell with the man; and the young man was to him as one of his sons.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Judg.17.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>Micah consecrated the Levite, and the young man became his priest, and was in the house of Micah.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Judg.17.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>Then Micah said, &ldquo;Now know I that Yahweh will do good to me, since I have a Levite to my priest.&rdquo;</span>

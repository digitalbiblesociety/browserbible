<span class="verse Judg_21_6" data-osis="Judg.21.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>The children of Israel grieved for Benjamin their brother, and said, &ldquo;There is one tribe cut off from Israel this day.</span>
<span class="verse Judg_21_7" data-osis="Judg.21.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>How shall we provide wives for those who remain, since we have sworn by Yahweh that we will not give them of our daughters to wives?&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse Judg_21_9" data-osis="Judg.21.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>For when the people were numbered, behold, there were none of the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead there.</span>
<span class="verse Judg_21_10" data-osis="Judg.21.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>The congregation sent there twelve thousand men of the most valiant, and commanded them, saying, &ldquo;Go and strike the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead with the edge of the sword, with the women and the little ones.</span>
<span class="verse Judg_21_11" data-osis="Judg.21.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>This is the thing that you shall do: you shall utterly destroy every male, and every woman who has lain with a man.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Judg_21_12" data-osis="Judg.21.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>They found among the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead four hundred young virgins, who had not known man by lying with him; and they brought them to the camp to Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan.</span>

<span class="verse Judg_21_17" data-osis="Judg.21.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>They said, &ldquo;There must be an inheritance for those who are escaped of Benjamin, that a tribe not be blotted out from Israel.</span>
<span class="verse Judg_21_18" data-osis="Judg.21.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>However we may not give them wives of our daughters, for the children of Israel had sworn, saying, &lsquo;Cursed is he who gives a wife to Benjamin.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Judg_21_19" data-osis="Judg.21.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>They said, &ldquo;Behold, there is a feast of Yahweh from year to year in Shiloh, which is on the north of Bethel, on the east side of the highway that goes up from Bethel to Shechem, and on the south of Lebonah.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Judg_21_20" data-osis="Judg.21.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>They commanded the children of Benjamin, saying, &ldquo;Go and lie in wait in the vineyards,</span>
<span class="verse Judg_21_21" data-osis="Judg.21.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>and see, and behold, if the daughters of Shiloh come out to dance in the dances, then come out of the vineyards, and each man catch his wife of the daughters of Shiloh, and go to the land of Benjamin.</span>
<span class="verse Judg_21_22" data-osis="Judg.21.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>It shall be, when their fathers or their brothers come to complain to us, that we will say to them, &lsquo;Grant them graciously to us, because we didn&rsquo;t take for each man his wife in battle, neither did you give them to them, otherwise you would now be guilty.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span>

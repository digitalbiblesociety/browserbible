<span class="verse" data-osis="Judg.3.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>Now these are the nations which Yahweh left, to prove Israel by them, even as many as had not known all the wars of Canaan;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Judg.3.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>only that the generations of the children of Israel might know, to teach them war, at the least such as before knew nothing of it:</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Judg.3.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>the five lords of the Philistines, and all the Canaanites, and the Sidonians, and the Hivites who lived on Mount Lebanon, from Mount Baal Hermon to the entrance of Hamath.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Judg.3.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>They were left to test Israel by them, to know whether they would listen to the commandments of Yahweh, which he commanded their fathers by Moses.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Judg.3.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>The children of Israel lived among the Canaanites, the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites:</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Judg.3.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>and they took their daughters to be their wives, and gave their own daughters to their sons and served their gods.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Judg.3.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>The children of Israel did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, and forgot Yahweh their God, and served the Baals and the Asheroth.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Judg.3.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>Therefore Yahweh&rsquo;s anger was kindled against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of Cushan Rishathaim king of Mesopotamia: and the children of Israel served Cushan Rishathaim eight years.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Judg.3.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>When the children of Israel cried to Yahweh, Yahweh raised up a savior to the children of Israel, who saved them, even Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb&rsquo;s younger brother.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Judg.3.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>The Spirit of Yahweh came on him, and he judged Israel; and he went out to war, and Yahweh delivered Cushan Rishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand: and his hand prevailed against Cushan Rishathaim.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Judg.3.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>The land had rest forty years. Othniel the son of Kenaz died.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Judg.3.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>The children of Israel again did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh: and Yahweh strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel, because they had done that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Judg.3.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>He gathered to him the children of Ammon and Amalek; and he went and struck Israel, and they possessed the city of palm trees.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Judg.3.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>The children of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Judg.3.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>But when the children of Israel cried to Yahweh, Yahweh raised them up a savior, Ehud the son of Gera, the Benjamite, a man left-handed. The children of Israel sent tribute by him to Eglon the king of Moab.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Judg.3.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span>Ehud made him a sword which had two edges, a cubit in length; and he wore it under his clothing on his right thigh.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Judg.3.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span>He offered the tribute to Eglon king of Moab: now Eglon was a very fat man.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Judg.3.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span>When he had made an end of offering the tribute, he sent away the people who bore the tribute.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Judg.3.19"><span class="verse-num">19&nbsp;</span>But he himself turned back from the quarries that were by Gilgal, and said, &ldquo;I have a secret errand to you, king.&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Judg.3.20"><span class="verse-num">20&nbsp;</span>Ehud came to him; and he was sitting by himself alone in the cool upper room. Ehud said, &ldquo;I have a message from God to you.&rdquo; He arose out of his seat.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Judg.3.21"><span class="verse-num">21&nbsp;</span>Ehud put out his left hand, and took the sword from his right thigh, and thrust it into his body:</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Judg.3.22"><span class="verse-num">22&nbsp;</span>and the handle also went in after the blade; and the fat closed on the blade, for he didn&rsquo;t draw the sword out of his body; and it came out behind.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Judg.3.23"><span class="verse-num">23&nbsp;</span>Then Ehud went out onto the porch, and shut the doors of the upper room on him, and locked them.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Judg.3.24"><span class="verse-num">24&nbsp;</span>Now when he was gone out, his servants came; and they saw, and behold, the doors of the upper room were locked; and they said, &ldquo;Surely he is covering his feet in the upper room.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Judg.3.25"><span class="verse-num">25&nbsp;</span>They waited until they were ashamed; and behold, he didn&rsquo;t open the doors of the upper room: therefore they took the key, and opened them, and behold, their lord was fallen down dead on the earth.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Judg.3.26"><span class="verse-num">26&nbsp;</span>Ehud escaped while they waited, and passed beyond the quarries, and escaped to Seirah.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Judg.3.27"><span class="verse-num">27&nbsp;</span>It happened, when he had come, that he blew a trumpet in the hill country of Ephraim; and the children of Israel went down with him from the hill country, and he before them.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Judg.3.28"><span class="verse-num">28&nbsp;</span>He said to them, &ldquo;Follow me; for Yahweh has delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand.&rdquo; They followed him, and took the fords of the Jordan against the Moabites, and didn&rsquo;t allow any man to pass over.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Judg.3.29"><span class="verse-num">29&nbsp;</span>They struck of Moab at that time about ten thousand men, every lusty man, and every man of valor; and there escaped not a man.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Judg.3.30"><span class="verse-num">30&nbsp;</span>So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. The land had rest eighty years.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Judg.3.31"><span class="verse-num">31&nbsp;</span>After him was Shamgar the son of Anath, who struck of the Philistines six hundred men with an ox goad: and he also saved Israel.</span>

<span class="verse Judg_9_2" data-osis="Judg.9.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Please speak in the ears of all the men of Shechem, &lsquo;Is it better for you that all the sons of Jerubbaal, who are seventy persons, rule over you, or that one rule over you?&rsquo; Remember also that I am your bone and your flesh.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Judg_9_3" data-osis="Judg.9.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>His mother&rsquo;s brothers spoke of him in the ears of all the men of Shechem all these words: and their hearts inclined to follow Abimelech; for they said, &ldquo;He is our brother.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Judg_9_4" data-osis="Judg.9.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>They gave him seventy pieces of silver out of the house of Baal Berith, with which Abimelech hired vain and light fellows, who followed him.</span>
<span class="verse Judg_9_5" data-osis="Judg.9.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>He went to his father&rsquo;s house at Ophrah, and killed his brothers the sons of Jerubbaal, being seventy persons, on one stone: but Jotham the youngest son of Jerubbaal was left; for he hid himself.</span>
<span class="verse Judg_9_6" data-osis="Judg.9.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>All the men of Shechem assembled themselves together, and all the house of Millo, and went and made Abimelech king, by the oak of the pillar that was in Shechem.</span>
<span class="verse Judg_9_7" data-osis="Judg.9.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>When they told it to Jotham, he went and stood on the top of Mount Gerizim, and lifted up his voice, and cried, and said to them, &ldquo;Listen to me, you men of Shechem, that God may listen to you.</span>
<span class="verse Judg_9_8" data-osis="Judg.9.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>The trees set out to anoint a king over themselves. They said to the olive tree, &lsquo;Reign over us.&rsquo;</span>

<p>
<span class="verse Judg_9_9" data-osis="Judg.9.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;But the olive tree said to them, &lsquo;Should I leave my fatness, with which by me they honor God and man, and go to wave back and forth over the trees?&rsquo;</span>

<span class="verse Judg_9_23" data-osis="Judg.9.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>God sent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the men of Shechem; and the men of Shechem dealt treacherously with Abimelech:</span>
<span class="verse Judg_9_24" data-osis="Judg.9.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span>that the violence done to the seventy sons of Jerubbaal might come, and that their blood might be laid on Abimelech their brother, who killed them, and on the men of Shechem, who strengthened his hands to kill his brothers.</span>
<span class="verse Judg_9_25" data-osis="Judg.9.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span>The men of Shechem set an ambush for him on the tops of the mountains, and they robbed all who came along that way by them: and it was told Abimelech.</span>
<span class="verse Judg_9_26" data-osis="Judg.9.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span>Gaal the son of Ebed came with his brothers, and went over to Shechem; and the men of Shechem put their trust in him.</span>
<span class="verse Judg_9_27" data-osis="Judg.9.27"><span class="verse-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span>They went out into the field, and harvested their vineyards, and trod the grapes, and held festival, and went into the house of their god, and ate and drank, and cursed Abimelech.</span>
<span class="verse Judg_9_28" data-osis="Judg.9.28"><span class="verse-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span>Gaal the son of Ebed said, &ldquo;Who is Abimelech, and who is Shechem, that we should serve him?

<span class="verse Judg_9_29" data-osis="Judg.9.29"><span class="verse-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span>Would that this people were under my hand! Then I would remove Abimelech.&rdquo; He said to Abimelech, &ldquo;Increase your army, and come out!&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Judg_9_30" data-osis="Judg.9.30"><span class="verse-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span>When Zebul the ruler of the city heard the words of Gaal the son of Ebed, his anger was kindled.</span>
<span class="verse Judg_9_31" data-osis="Judg.9.31"><span class="verse-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span>He sent messengers to Abimelech craftily, saying, &ldquo;Behold, Gaal the son of Ebed and his brothers have come to Shechem; and behold, they incite the city against you.</span>
<span class="verse Judg_9_32" data-osis="Judg.9.32"><span class="verse-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span>Now therefore, go up by night, you and the people who are with you, and lie in wait in the field:</span>
<span class="verse Judg_9_33" data-osis="Judg.9.33"><span class="verse-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span>and it shall be, that in the morning, as soon as the sun is up, you shall rise early, and rush on the city; and behold, when he and the people who are with him come out against you, then may you do to them as you shall find occasion.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Judg_9_34" data-osis="Judg.9.34"><span class="verse-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span>Abimelech rose up, and all the people who were with him, by night, and they laid wait against Shechem in four companies.</span>
<span class="verse Judg_9_35" data-osis="Judg.9.35"><span class="verse-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span>Gaal the son of Ebed went out, and stood in the entrance of the gate of the city: and Abimelech rose up, and the people who were with him, from the ambush.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Judg_9_36" data-osis="Judg.9.36"><span class="verse-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span>When Gaal saw the people, he said to Zebul, &ldquo;Behold, people are coming down from the tops of the mountains.&rdquo;<br>Zebul said to him, “You see the shadow of the mountains as if they were men.”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Judg_9_37" data-osis="Judg.9.37"><span class="verse-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span>Gaal spoke again and said, &ldquo;Behold, people are coming down by the middle of the land, and one company comes by the way of the oak of Meonenim.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Judg_9_38" data-osis="Judg.9.38"><span class="verse-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span>Then Zebul said to him, &ldquo;Now where is your mouth, that you said, &lsquo;Who is Abimelech, that we should serve him?&rsquo; Isn&rsquo;t this the people that you have despised?

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Judg_9_39" data-osis="Judg.9.39"><span class="verse-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span>Gaal went out before the men of Shechem, and fought with Abimelech.</span>
<span class="verse Judg_9_40" data-osis="Judg.9.40"><span class="verse-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span>Abimelech chased him, and he fled before him, and many fell wounded, even to the entrance of the gate.</span>
<span class="verse Judg_9_41" data-osis="Judg.9.41"><span class="verse-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span>Abimelech lived at Arumah: and Zebul drove out Gaal and his brothers, that they should not dwell in Shechem.</span>
<span class="verse Judg_9_42" data-osis="Judg.9.42"><span class="verse-num v-42">42&nbsp;</span>It happened on the next day, that the people went out into the field; and they told Abimelech.</span>
<span class="verse Judg_9_43" data-osis="Judg.9.43"><span class="verse-num v-43">43&nbsp;</span>He took the people, and divided them into three companies, and laid wait in the field; and he looked, and behold, the people came out of the city; He rose up against them, and struck them.</span>
<span class="verse Judg_9_44" data-osis="Judg.9.44"><span class="verse-num v-44">44&nbsp;</span>Abimelech, and the companies that were with him, rushed forward, and stood in the entrance of the gate of the city: and the two companies rushed on all who were in the field, and struck them.</span>
<span class="verse Judg_9_45" data-osis="Judg.9.45"><span class="verse-num v-45">45&nbsp;</span>Abimelech fought against the city all that day; and he took the city, and killed the people who were therein: and he beat down the city, and sowed it with salt.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Judg_9_46" data-osis="Judg.9.46"><span class="verse-num v-46">46&nbsp;</span>When all the men of the tower of Shechem heard of it, they entered into the stronghold of the house of Elberith.</span>
<span class="verse Judg_9_47" data-osis="Judg.9.47"><span class="verse-num v-47">47&nbsp;</span>It was told Abimelech that all the men of the tower of Shechem were gathered together.</span>
<span class="verse Judg_9_48" data-osis="Judg.9.48"><span class="verse-num v-48">48&nbsp;</span>Abimelech went up to Mount Zalmon, he and all the people who were with him; and Abimelech took an ax in his hand, and cut down a bough from the trees, and took it up, and laid it on his shoulder: and he said to the people who were with him, &ldquo;What you have seen me do, make haste, and do as I have done!&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Judg_9_49" data-osis="Judg.9.49"><span class="verse-num v-49">49&nbsp;</span>All the people likewise each cut down his bough, and followed Abimelech, and put them at the base of the stronghold, and set the stronghold on fire on them; so that all the people of the tower of Shechem died also, about a thousand men and women.</span>
<span class="verse Judg_9_50" data-osis="Judg.9.50"><span class="verse-num v-50">50&nbsp;</span>Then went Abimelech to Thebez, and encamped against Thebez, and took it.</span>
<span class="verse Judg_9_51" data-osis="Judg.9.51"><span class="verse-num v-51">51&nbsp;</span>But there was a strong tower within the city, and there fled all the men and women, and all they of the city, and shut themselves in, and went up to the roof of the tower.</span>
<span class="verse Judg_9_52" data-osis="Judg.9.52"><span class="verse-num v-52">52&nbsp;</span>Abimelech came to the tower, and fought against it, and drew near to the door of the tower to burn it with fire.</span>
<span class="verse Judg_9_53" data-osis="Judg.9.53"><span class="verse-num v-53">53&nbsp;</span>A certain woman cast an upper millstone on Abimelech&rsquo;s head, and broke his skull.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Judg_9_54" data-osis="Judg.9.54"><span class="verse-num v-54">54&nbsp;</span>Then he called hastily to the young man his armor bearer, and said to him, &ldquo;Draw your sword, and kill me, that men not say of me, &lsquo;A woman killed him.&rsquo; His young man thrust him through, and he died.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Judg_9_55" data-osis="Judg.9.55"><span class="verse-num v-55">55&nbsp;</span>When the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead, they departed every man to his place.</span>
<span class="verse Judg_9_56" data-osis="Judg.9.56"><span class="verse-num v-56">56&nbsp;</span>Thus God requited the wickedness of Abimelech, which he did to his father, in killing his seventy brothers;</span>
<span class="verse Judg_9_57" data-osis="Judg.9.57"><span class="verse-num v-57">57&nbsp;</span>and all the wickedness of the men of Shechem did God requite on their heads: and on them came the curse of Jotham the son of Jerubbaal.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.20.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>Now Pashhur, the son of Immer the priest, who was chief officer in the house of Yahweh, heard Jeremiah prophesying these things.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.20.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>Then Pashhur struck Jeremiah the prophet, and put him in the stocks that were in the upper gate of Benjamin, which was in the house of Yahweh.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.20.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>It happened on the next day, that Pashhur released Jeremiah out of the stocks. Then Jeremiah said to him, Yahweh has not called your name Pashhur, but Magormissabib.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.20.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>For thus says Yahweh, Behold, I will make you a terror to yourself, and to all your friends; and they shall fall by the sword of their enemies, and your eyes shall see it; and I will give all Judah into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall carry them captive to Babylon, and shall kill them with the sword.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.20.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>Moreover I will give all the riches of this city, and all its gains, and all the precious things of it, yes, all the treasures of the kings of Judah will I give into the hand of their enemies; and they shall make them captives, and take them, and carry them to Babylon.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.20.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>You, Pashhur, and all who dwell in your house shall go into captivity; and you shall come to Babylon, and there you shall die, and there you shall be buried, you, and all your friends, to whom you have prophesied falsely.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.20.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>Yahweh, you have persuaded me, and I was persuaded; you are stronger than I, and have prevailed: I am become a laughing-stock all the day, every one mocks me.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.20.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>For as often as I speak, I cry out; I cry, Violence and destruction! because the word of Yahweh is made a reproach to me, and a derision, all the day.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.20.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>If I say, I will not make mention of him, nor speak any more in his name, then there is in my heart as it were a burning fire shut up in my bones, and I am weary with forbearing, and I can&rsquo;t.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.20.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>For I have heard the defaming of many, terror on every side. Denounce, and we will denounce him, say all my familiar friends, those who watch for my fall; perhaps he will be persuaded, and we shall prevail against him, and we shall take our revenge on him.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.20.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>But Yahweh is with me as an awesome mighty one: therefore my persecutors shall stumble, and they shall not prevail; they shall be utterly disappointed, because they have not dealt wisely, even with an everlasting dishonor which shall never be forgotten.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.20.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>But, Yahweh of Armies, who tests the righteous, who sees the heart and the mind, let me see your vengeance on them; for to you have I revealed my cause.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.20.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>Sing to Yahweh, praise Yahweh; for he has delivered the soul of the needy from the hand of evildoers.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.20.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>Cursed is the day in which I was born: don&rsquo;t let the day in which my mother bore me be blessed.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.20.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>Cursed is the man who brought news to my father, saying, A boy is born to you; making him very glad.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.20.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span>Let that man be as the cities which Yahweh overthrew, and didn&rsquo;t repent: and let him hear a cry in the morning, and shouting at noontime;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.20.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span>because he didn&rsquo;t kill me from the womb; and so my mother would have been my grave, and her womb always great.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.20.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span>Why did I come out of the womb to see labor and sorrow, that my days should be consumed with shame?</span>

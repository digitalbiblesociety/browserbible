<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.3.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>I am the man that has seen affliction by the rod of his wrath.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.3.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>He has led me and caused me to walk in darkness, and not in light.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.3.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>Surely against me he turns his hand again and again all the day.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.3.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>My flesh and my skin has he made old; he has broken my bones.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.3.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>He has built against me, and surrounded me with gall and travail.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.3.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>He has made me to dwell in dark places, as those that have been long dead.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.3.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>He has walled me about, that I can&rsquo;t go out; he has made my chain heavy.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.3.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>Yes, when I cry, and call for help, he shuts out my prayer.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.3.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>He has walled up my ways with cut stone; he has made my paths crooked.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.3.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>He is to me as a bear lying in wait, as a lion in secret places.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.3.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>He has turned aside my ways, and pulled me in pieces; he has made me desolate.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.3.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>He has bent his bow, and set me as a mark for the arrow.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.3.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>He has caused the shafts of his quiver to enter into my kidneys.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.3.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>I am become a derision to all my people, and their song all the day.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.3.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>He has filled me with bitterness, he has sated me with wormwood.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.3.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span>He has also broken my teeth with gravel stones; he has covered me with ashes.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.3.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span>You have removed my soul far off from peace; I forgot prosperity.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.3.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span>I said, My strength is perished, and my expectation from Yahweh.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.3.19"><span class="verse-num">19&nbsp;</span>Remember my affliction and my misery, the wormwood and the gall.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.3.20"><span class="verse-num">20&nbsp;</span>My soul still remembers them, and is bowed down within me.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.3.21"><span class="verse-num">21&nbsp;</span>This I recall to my mind; therefore have I hope.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.3.22"><span class="verse-num">22&nbsp;</span>It is because of Yahweh&rsquo;s loving kindnesses that we are not consumed, because his compassion doesn&rsquo;t fail.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.3.23"><span class="verse-num">23&nbsp;</span>They are new every morning; great is your faithfulness.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.3.24"><span class="verse-num">24&nbsp;</span>Yahweh is my portion, says my soul; therefore will I hope in him.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.3.25"><span class="verse-num">25&nbsp;</span>Yahweh is good to those who wait for him, to the soul that seeks him.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.3.26"><span class="verse-num">26&nbsp;</span>It is good that a man should hope and quietly wait for the salvation of Yahweh.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.3.27"><span class="verse-num">27&nbsp;</span>It is good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.3.28"><span class="verse-num">28&nbsp;</span>Let him sit alone and keep silence, because he has laid it on him.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.3.29"><span class="verse-num">29&nbsp;</span>Let him put his mouth in the dust, if so be there may be hope.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.3.30"><span class="verse-num">30&nbsp;</span>Let him give his cheek to him who strikes him; let him be filled full with reproach.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.3.31"><span class="verse-num">31&nbsp;</span>For the Lord will not cast off forever.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.3.32"><span class="verse-num">32&nbsp;</span>For though he cause grief, yet he will have compassion according to the multitude of his loving kindnesses.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.3.33"><span class="verse-num">33&nbsp;</span>For he does not afflict willingly, nor grieve the children of men.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.3.34"><span class="verse-num">34&nbsp;</span>To crush under foot all the prisoners of the earth,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.3.35"><span class="verse-num">35&nbsp;</span>To turn aside the right of a man before the face of the Most High,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.3.36"><span class="verse-num">36&nbsp;</span>To subvert a man in his cause, the Lord doesn&rsquo;t approve.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.3.37"><span class="verse-num">37&nbsp;</span>Who is he who says, and it comes to pass, when the Lord doesn&rsquo;t command it?</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.3.38"><span class="verse-num">38&nbsp;</span>Doesn&rsquo;t evil and good come out of the mouth of the Most High?</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.3.39"><span class="verse-num">39&nbsp;</span>Why does a living man complain, a man for the punishment of his sins?</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.3.40"><span class="verse-num">40&nbsp;</span>Let us search and try our ways, and turn again to Yahweh.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.3.41"><span class="verse-num">41&nbsp;</span>Let us lift up our heart with our hands to God<span class="note">+<dfn>The Hebrew word rendered &ldquo;God&rdquo; is &ldquo;Elohim.&rdquo;</dfn></span> in the heavens.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.3.42"><span class="verse-num">42&nbsp;</span>We have transgressed and have rebelled; you have not pardoned.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.3.43"><span class="verse-num">43&nbsp;</span>You have covered with anger and pursued us; you have killed, you have not pitied.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.3.44"><span class="verse-num">44&nbsp;</span>You have covered yourself with a cloud, so that no prayer can pass through.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.3.45"><span class="verse-num">45&nbsp;</span>You have made us an off-scouring and refuse in the midst of the peoples.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.3.46"><span class="verse-num">46&nbsp;</span>All our enemies have opened their mouth wide against us.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.3.47"><span class="verse-num">47&nbsp;</span>Fear and the pit have come on us, devastation and destruction.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.3.48"><span class="verse-num">48&nbsp;</span>My eye runs down with streams of water, for the destruction of the daughter of my people.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.3.49"><span class="verse-num">49&nbsp;</span>My eye pours down, and doesn&rsquo;t cease, without any intermission,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.3.50"><span class="verse-num">50&nbsp;</span>Until Yahweh look down, and see from heaven.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.3.51"><span class="verse-num">51&nbsp;</span>My eye affects my soul, because of all the daughters of my city.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.3.52"><span class="verse-num">52&nbsp;</span>They have chased me relentlessly like a bird, those who are my enemies without cause.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.3.53"><span class="verse-num">53&nbsp;</span>They have cut off my life in the dungeon, and have cast a stone on me.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.3.54"><span class="verse-num">54&nbsp;</span>Waters flowed over my head; I said, I am cut off.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.3.55"><span class="verse-num">55&nbsp;</span>I called on your name, Yahweh, out of the lowest dungeon.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.3.56"><span class="verse-num">56&nbsp;</span>You heard my voice; don&rsquo;t hide your ear at my breathing, at my cry.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.3.57"><span class="verse-num">57&nbsp;</span>You drew near in the day that I called on you; you said, Don&rsquo;t be afraid.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.3.58"><span class="verse-num">58&nbsp;</span>Lord, you have pleaded the causes of my soul; you have redeemed my life.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.3.59"><span class="verse-num">59&nbsp;</span>Yahweh, you have seen my wrong. Judge my cause.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.3.60"><span class="verse-num">60&nbsp;</span>You have seen all their vengeance and all their devices against me.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.3.61"><span class="verse-num">61&nbsp;</span>You have heard their reproach, Yahweh, and all their devices against me,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.3.62"><span class="verse-num">62&nbsp;</span>The lips of those that rose up against me, and their device against me all the day.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.3.63"><span class="verse-num">63&nbsp;</span>You see their sitting down, and their rising up; I am their song.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.3.64"><span class="verse-num">64&nbsp;</span>You will render to them a recompense, Yahweh, according to the work of their hands.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.3.65"><span class="verse-num">65&nbsp;</span>You will give them hardness of heart, your curse to them.</span>

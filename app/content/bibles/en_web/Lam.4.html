<span class="verse Lam_4_1" data-osis="Lam.4.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>How the gold has become dim! The most pure gold has changed!<br /> The stones of the sanctuary are poured out at the head of every street.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Lam_4_2" data-osis="Lam.4.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>The precious sons of Zion, comparable to fine gold,<br /> How are they esteemed as earthen pitchers, the work of the hands of the potter!<br /></span>
<span class="verse Lam_4_3" data-osis="Lam.4.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>Even the jackals draw out the breast, they nurse their young ones:<br /> The daughter of my people has become cruel, like the ostriches in the wilderness.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Lam_4_4" data-osis="Lam.4.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>The tongue of the nursing child clings to the roof of his mouth for thirst:<br /> The young children ask bread, and no man breaks it to them.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Lam_4_5" data-osis="Lam.4.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>Those who fed delicately are desolate in the streets:<br /> Those who were brought up in scarlet embrace dunghills.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Lam_4_6" data-osis="Lam.4.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>For the iniquity of the daughter of my people is greater than the sin of Sodom,<br /> That was overthrown as in a moment, and no hands were laid on her.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Lam_4_7" data-osis="Lam.4.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>Her nobles were purer than snow, they were whiter than milk;<br /> They were more ruddy in body than rubies, their polishing was as of sapphire.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Lam_4_8" data-osis="Lam.4.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>Their appearance is blacker than a coal; they are not known in the streets:<br /> Their skin clings to their bones; it is withered, it has become like a stick.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Lam_4_9" data-osis="Lam.4.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>Those who are killed with the sword are better than those who are killed with hunger;<br /> For these pine away, stricken through, for want of the fruits of the field.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Lam_4_10" data-osis="Lam.4.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>The hands of the pitiful women have boiled their own children;<br /> They were their food in the destruction of the daughter of my people.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Lam_4_11" data-osis="Lam.4.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>Yahweh has accomplished his wrath, he has poured out his fierce anger;<br /> He has kindled a fire in Zion, which has devoured its foundations.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Lam_4_12" data-osis="Lam.4.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>The kings of the earth didn&rsquo;t believe, neither all the inhabitants of the world,<br /> That the adversary and the enemy would enter into the gates of Jerusalem.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Lam_4_13" data-osis="Lam.4.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>It is because of the sins of her prophets, and the iniquities of her priests,<br /> That have shed the blood of the just in the midst of her.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Lam_4_14" data-osis="Lam.4.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>They wander as blind men in the streets, they are polluted with blood,<br /> So that men can&rsquo;t touch their garments.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Lam_4_15" data-osis="Lam.4.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>Depart! they cried to them, Unclean! depart, depart, don&rsquo;t touch!<br /> When they fled away and wandered, men said among the nations, They shall not live here any more.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Lam_4_16" data-osis="Lam.4.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>Yahweh&rsquo;s anger has scattered them; he will no more regard them:<br /> They didn&rsquo;t respect the persons of the priests, they didn&rsquo;t favor the elders.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Lam_4_17" data-osis="Lam.4.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>Our eyes still fail, looking in vain for our help:<br /> In our watching we have watched for a nation that could not save.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Lam_4_18" data-osis="Lam.4.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>They hunt our steps, so that we can&rsquo;t go in our streets:<br /> Our end is near, our days are fulfilled; for our end has come.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Lam_4_19" data-osis="Lam.4.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>Our pursuers were swifter than the eagles of the sky:<br /> They chased us on the mountains, they laid wait for us in the wilderness.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Lam_4_20" data-osis="Lam.4.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>The breath of our nostrils, the anointed of Yahweh, was taken in their pits;<br /> Of whom we said, Under his shadow we shall live among the nations.</span>
<br /><br />

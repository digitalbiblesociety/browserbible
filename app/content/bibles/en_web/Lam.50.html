<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.50.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>The word that Yahweh spoke concerning Babylon, concerning the land of the Chaldeans, by Jeremiah the prophet.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.50.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>Declare among the nations and publish, and set up a standard; publish, and don&rsquo;t conceal: say, Babylon is taken, Bel is disappointed, Merodach is dismayed; her images are disappointed, her idols are dismayed.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.50.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>For out of the north there comes up a nation against her, which shall make her land desolate, and no one shall dwell therein: they are fled, they are gone, both man and animal.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.50.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>In those days, and in that time, says Yahweh, the children of Israel shall come, they and the children of Judah together; they shall go on their way weeping, and shall seek Yahweh their God.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.50.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>They shall inquire concerning Zion with their faces turned toward it, saying, Come, and join yourselves to Yahweh in an everlasting covenant that shall not be forgotten.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.50.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>My people have been lost sheep: their shepherds have caused them to go astray; they have turned them away on the mountains; they have gone from mountain to hill; they have forgotten their resting place.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.50.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>All who found them have devoured them; and their adversaries said, We are not guilty, because they have sinned against Yahweh, the habitation of righteousness, even Yahweh, the hope of their fathers.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.50.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>Flee out of the midst of Babylon, and go out of the land of the Chaldeans, and be as the male goats before the flocks.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.50.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>For, behold, I will stir up and cause to come up against Babylon a company of great nations from the north country; and they shall set themselves in array against her; from there she shall be taken: their arrows shall be as of an expert mighty man; no one shall return in vain.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.50.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>Chaldea shall be a prey: all who prey on her shall be satisfied, says Yahweh.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.50.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>Because you are glad, because you rejoice, O you who plunder my heritage, because you are wanton as a heifer that treads out the grain, and neigh as strong horses;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.50.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>your mother shall be utterly disappointed; she who bore you shall be confounded: behold, she shall be the least of the nations, a wilderness, a dry land, and a desert.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.50.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>Because of the wrath of Yahweh she shall not be inhabited, but she shall be wholly desolate: everyone who goes by Babylon shall be astonished, and hiss at all her plagues.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.50.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>Set yourselves in array against Babylon all around, all you who bend the bow; shoot at her, spare no arrows: for she has sinned against Yahweh.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.50.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>Shout against her all around: she has submitted herself; her bulwarks are fallen, her walls are thrown down; for it is the vengeance of Yahweh: take vengeance on her; as she has done, do to her.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.50.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span>Cut off the sower from Babylon, and him who handles the sickle in the time of harvest: for fear of the oppressing sword they shall turn everyone to his people, and they shall flee everyone to his own land.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.50.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span>Israel is a hunted sheep; the lions have driven him away: first, the king of Assyria devoured him; and now at last Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon has broken his bones.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.50.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span>Therefore thus says Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel: Behold, I will punish the king of Babylon and his land, as I have punished the king of Assyria.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.50.19"><span class="verse-num">19&nbsp;</span>I will bring Israel again to his pasture, and he shall feed on Carmel and Bashan, and his soul shall be satisfied on the hills of Ephraim and in Gilead.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.50.20"><span class="verse-num">20&nbsp;</span>In those days, and in that time, says Yahweh, the iniquity of Israel shall be sought for, and there shall be no one; and the sins of Judah, and they shall not be found: for I will pardon them whom I leave as a remnant.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.50.21"><span class="verse-num">21&nbsp;</span>Go up against the land of Merathaim, even against it, and against the inhabitants of Pekod: kill and utterly destroy after them, says Yahweh, and do according to all that I have commanded you.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.50.22"><span class="verse-num">22&nbsp;</span>A sound of battle is in the land, and of great destruction.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.50.23"><span class="verse-num">23&nbsp;</span>How is the hammer of the whole earth cut apart and broken! how is Babylon become a desolation among the nations!</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.50.24"><span class="verse-num">24&nbsp;</span>I have laid a snare for you, and you are also taken, Babylon, and you weren&rsquo;t aware: you are found, and also caught, because you have striven against Yahweh.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.50.25"><span class="verse-num">25&nbsp;</span>Yahweh has opened his armory, and has brought out the weapons of his indignation; for the Lord, Yahweh of Armies, has a work to do in the land of the Chaldeans.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.50.26"><span class="verse-num">26&nbsp;</span>Come against her from the utmost border; open her storehouses; cast her up as heaps, and destroy her utterly; let nothing of her be left.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.50.27"><span class="verse-num">27&nbsp;</span>Kill all her bulls; let them go down to the slaughter: woe to them! for their day has come, the time of their visitation.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.50.28"><span class="verse-num">28&nbsp;</span>The voice of those who flee and escape out of the land of Babylon, to declare in Zion the vengeance of Yahweh our God, the vengeance of his temple.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.50.29"><span class="verse-num">29&nbsp;</span>Call together the archers against Babylon, all those who bend the bow; encamp against her all around; let none of it escape: recompense her according to her work; according to all that she has done, do to her; for she has been proud against Yahweh, against the Holy One of Israel.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.50.30"><span class="verse-num">30&nbsp;</span>Therefore her young men will fall in her streets, and all her men of war will be brought to silence in that day, says Yahweh.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.50.31"><span class="verse-num">31&nbsp;</span>Behold, I am against you, you proud one, says the Lord, Yahweh of Armies; for your day has come, the time that I will visit you.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.50.32"><span class="verse-num">32&nbsp;</span>The proud one shall stumble and fall, and no one shall raise him up; and I will kindle a fire in his cities, and it shall devour all who are around him.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.50.33"><span class="verse-num">33&nbsp;</span>Thus says Yahweh of Armies: The children of Israel and the children of Judah are oppressed together; and all who took them captive hold them fast; they refuse to let them go.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.50.34"><span class="verse-num">34&nbsp;</span>Their Redeemer is strong; Yahweh of Armies is his name: he will thoroughly plead their cause, that he may give rest to the earth, and disquiet the inhabitants of Babylon.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.50.35"><span class="verse-num">35&nbsp;</span>A sword is on the Chaldeans, says Yahweh, and on the inhabitants of Babylon, and on her princes, and on her wise men.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.50.36"><span class="verse-num">36&nbsp;</span>A sword is on the boasters, and they shall become fools; a sword is on her mighty men, and they shall be dismayed.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.50.37"><span class="verse-num">37&nbsp;</span>A sword is on their horses, and on their chariots, and on all the mixed people who are in the midst of her; and they shall become as women: a sword is on her treasures, and they shall be robbed.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.50.38"><span class="verse-num">38&nbsp;</span>A drought is on her waters, and they shall be dried up; for it is a land of engraved images, and they are mad over idols.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.50.39"><span class="verse-num">39&nbsp;</span>Therefore the wild animals of the desert with the wolves shall dwell there, and the ostriches shall dwell therein: and it shall be no more inhabited forever; neither shall it be lived in from generation to generation.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.50.40"><span class="verse-num">40&nbsp;</span>As when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighbor cities of it, says Yahweh, so shall no man dwell there, neither shall any son of man live therein.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.50.41"><span class="verse-num">41&nbsp;</span>Behold, a people comes from the north; and a great nation and many kings shall be stirred up from the uttermost parts of the earth.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.50.42"><span class="verse-num">42&nbsp;</span>They lay hold on bow and spear; they are cruel, and have no mercy; their voice roars like the sea; and they ride on horses, everyone set in array, as a man to the battle, against you, daughter of Babylon.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.50.43"><span class="verse-num">43&nbsp;</span>The king of Babylon has heard the news of them, and his hands wax feeble: anguish has taken hold of him, pains as of a woman in labor.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.50.44"><span class="verse-num">44&nbsp;</span>Behold, the enemy shall come up like a lion from the pride of the Jordan against the strong habitation: for I will suddenly make them run away from it; and whoever is chosen, him will I appoint over it: for who is like me? and who will appoint me a time? and who is the shepherd who can stand before me?</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.50.45"><span class="verse-num">45&nbsp;</span>Therefore hear the counsel of Yahweh, that he has taken against Babylon; and his purposes, that he has purposed against the land of the Chaldeans: Surely they shall drag them away, even the little ones of the flock; surely he shall make their habitation desolate over them.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.50.46"><span class="verse-num">46&nbsp;</span>At the noise of the taking of Babylon the earth trembles, and the cry is heard among the nations.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lev.25.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>What grows of itself in your harvest you shall not reap, and you shall not gather the grapes of your undressed vine. It shall be a year of solemn rest for the land.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lev.25.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>The Sabbath of the land shall be for food for you; for yourself, for your servant, for your maid, for your hired servant, and for your stranger, who lives as a foreigner with you.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lev.25.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>For your livestock also, and for the animals that are in your land, shall all its increase be for food.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lev.25.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>That fiftieth year shall be a jubilee to you. In it you shall not sow, neither reap that which grows of itself, nor gather from the undressed vines.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lev.25.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>For it is a jubilee; it shall be holy to you. You shall eat of its increase out of the field.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lev.25.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span>According to the length of the years you shall increase its price, and according to the shortness of the years you shall diminish its price; for he is selling the number of the crops to you.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Lev.25.23"><span class="verse-num">23&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;&lsquo;The land shall not be sold in perpetuity, for the land is mine; for you are strangers and live as foreigners with me.</span>

<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Lev.25.25"><span class="verse-num">25&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;&lsquo;If your brother becomes poor, and sells some of his possessions, then his kinsman who is next to him shall come, and redeem that which his brother has sold.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lev.25.26"><span class="verse-num">26&nbsp;</span>If a man has no one to redeem it, and he becomes prosperous and finds sufficient means to redeem it;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lev.25.28"><span class="verse-num">28&nbsp;</span>But if he isn&rsquo;t able to get it back for himself, then what he has sold shall remain in the hand of him who has bought it until the Year of Jubilee: and in the Jubilee it shall be released, and he shall return to his property.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Lev.25.29"><span class="verse-num">29&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;&lsquo;If a man sells a dwelling house in a walled city, then he may redeem it within a whole year after it has been sold. For a full year he shall have the right of redemption.</span>

It shall not be released in the Jubilee.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lev.25.31"><span class="verse-num">31&nbsp;</span>But the houses of the villages which have no wall around them shall be reckoned with the fields of the country: they may be redeemed, and they shall be released in the Jubilee.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Lev.25.32"><span class="verse-num">32&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;&lsquo;Nevertheless the cities of the Levites, the houses in the cities of their possession, the Levites may redeem at any time.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lev.25.33"><span class="verse-num">33&nbsp;</span>The Levites may redeem the house that was sold, and the city of his possession, and it shall be released in the Jubilee; for the houses of the cities of the Levites are their possession among the children of Israel.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lev.25.34"><span class="verse-num">34&nbsp;</span>But the field of the suburbs of their cities may not be sold; for it is their perpetual possession.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Lev.25.35"><span class="verse-num">35&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;&lsquo;If your brother has become poor, and his hand can&rsquo;t support himself among you; then you shall uphold him. He shall live with you like an alien and a temporary resident.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lev.25.36"><span class="verse-num">36&nbsp;</span>Take no interest from him or profit, but fear your God; that your brother may live among you.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lev.25.37"><span class="verse-num">37&nbsp;</span>You shall not lend him your money at interest, nor give him your food for profit.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lev.25.42"><span class="verse-num">42&nbsp;</span>For they are my servants, whom I brought out of the land of Egypt. They shall not be sold as slaves.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lev.25.43"><span class="verse-num">43&nbsp;</span>You shall not rule over him with harshness, but shall fear your God.</span>

<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Lev.25.44"><span class="verse-num">44&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;&lsquo;As for your male and your female slaves, whom you may have; of the nations that are around you, from them you may buy male and female slaves.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lev.25.45"><span class="verse-num">45&nbsp;</span>Moreover of the children of the aliens who live among you, of them you may buy, and of their families who are with you, which they have conceived in your land; and they will be your property.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lev.25.46"><span class="verse-num">46&nbsp;</span>You may make them an inheritance for your children after you, to hold for a possession; of them may you take your slaves forever; but over your brothers the children of Israel you shall not rule, one over another, with harshness.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Lev.25.47"><span class="verse-num">47&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;&lsquo;If an alien or temporary resident with you becomes rich, and your brother beside him has grown poor, and sells himself to the stranger or foreigner living among you, or to a member of the stranger&rsquo;s family;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lev.25.48"><span class="verse-num">48&nbsp;</span>after he is sold he may be redeemed. One of his brothers may redeem him;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lev.25.50"><span class="verse-num">50&nbsp;</span>He shall reckon with him who bought him from the year that he sold himself to him to the Year of Jubilee.

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lev.25.51"><span class="verse-num">51&nbsp;</span>If there are yet many years, according to them he shall give back the price of his redemption out of the money that he was bought for.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lev.25.52"><span class="verse-num">52&nbsp;</span>If there remain but a few years to the year of jubilee, then he shall reckon with him; according to his years of service he shall give back the price of his redemption.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lev.25.53"><span class="verse-num">53&nbsp;</span>As a servant hired year by year shall he be with him. He shall not rule with harshness over him in your sight.</span>

<span class="verse Luke_11_34" data-osis="Luke.11.34"><span class="verse-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> The lamp of the body is the eye. Therefore when your eye is good, your whole body is also full of light; but when it is evil, your body also is full of darkness. </span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_11_35" data-osis="Luke.11.35"><span class="verse-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Therefore see whether the light that is in you isn&rsquo;t darkness. </span></span>

<span class="verse Luke_11_43" data-osis="Luke.11.43"><span class="verse-num v-43">43&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Woe to you Pharisees! For you love the best seats in the synagogues, and the greetings in the marketplaces. </span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_11_44" data-osis="Luke.11.44"><span class="verse-num v-44">44&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you are like hidden graves, and the men who walk over them don&rsquo;t know it.&rdquo;</span></span>

<p>
<span class="verse Luke_11_46" data-osis="Luke.11.46"><span class="verse-num v-46">46&nbsp;</span>He said, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Woe to you lawyers also!

<span class="verse Luke_11_47" data-osis="Luke.11.47"><span class="verse-num v-47">47&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Woe to you! For you build the tombs of the prophets, and your fathers killed them. </span></span>

<span class="verse Luke_11_49" data-osis="Luke.11.49"><span class="verse-num v-49">49&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Therefore also the wisdom of God said, &lsquo;I will send to them prophets and apostles; and some of them they will kill and persecute, </span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_11_50" data-osis="Luke.11.50"><span class="verse-num v-50">50&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> that the blood of all the prophets, which was shed from the foundation of the world, may be required of this generation; </span></span>

<span class="verse Luke_11_53" data-osis="Luke.11.53"><span class="verse-num v-53">53&nbsp;</span>As he said these things to them, the scribes and the Pharisees began to be terribly angry, and to draw many things out of him;</span>

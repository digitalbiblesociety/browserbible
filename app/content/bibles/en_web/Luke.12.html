<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.12.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> But the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Therefore don&rsquo;t be afraid. You are of more value than many sparrows.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.12.28"><span class="verse-num">28&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> But if this is how God clothes the grass in the field, which today exists, and tomorrow is cast into the oven, how much more will he clothe you, O you of little faith? </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.12.29"><span class="verse-num">29&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Don&rsquo;t seek what you will eat or what you will drink; neither be anxious. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.12.30"><span class="verse-num">30&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> For the nations of the world seek after all of these things, but your Father knows that you need these things. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.12.31"><span class="verse-num">31&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> But seek God&rsquo;s Kingdom, and all these things will be added to you. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.12.46"><span class="verse-num">46&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> then the lord of that servant will come in a day when he isn&rsquo;t expecting him, and in an hour that he doesn&rsquo;t know, and will cut him in two, and place his portion with the unfaithful. </span></span>

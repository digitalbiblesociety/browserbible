<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.22.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>They were glad, and agreed to give him money.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.22.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>He consented, and sought an opportunity to deliver him to them in the absence of the multitude.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.22.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>The day of unleavened bread came, on which the Passover must be sacrificed.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.22.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>He said to them, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Behold, when you have entered into the city, a man carrying a pitcher of water will meet you. Follow him into the house which he enters. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.22.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Tell the master of the house, &lsquo;The Teacher says to you, &ldquo;Where is the guest room, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?&rdquo;&rsquo; </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.22.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>He said to them, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;I have earnestly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer, </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.22.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> for I tell you, I will no longer by any means eat of it until it is fulfilled in the Kingdom of God.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.22.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span>He received a cup, and when he had given thanks, he said, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Take this, and share it among yourselves, </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.22.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> for I tell you, I will not drink at all again from the fruit of the vine, until the Kingdom of God comes.&rdquo;</span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.22.19"><span class="verse-num">19&nbsp;</span>He took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it, and gave to them, saying, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;This is my body which is given for you. Do this in memory of me.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.22.20"><span class="verse-num">20&nbsp;</span>Likewise, he took the cup after supper, saying, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;This cup is the new covenant in my blood, which is poured out for you. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.22.26"><span class="verse-num">26&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> But not so with you. But one who is the greater among you, let him become as the younger, and one who is governing, as one who serves. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.22.27"><span class="verse-num">27&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> For who is greater, one who sits at the table, or one who serves? Isn&rsquo;t it he who sits at the table? But I am in your midst as one who serves. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.22.28"><span class="verse-num">28&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> But you are those who have continued with me in my trials. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.22.29"><span class="verse-num">29&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> I confer on you a kingdom, even as my Father conferred on me, </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.22.30"><span class="verse-num">30&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> that you may eat and drink at my table in my Kingdom. You will sit on thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.22.31"><span class="verse-num">31&nbsp;</span>The Lord said, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Simon, Simon, behold, Satan asked to have you, that he might sift you as wheat, </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.22.32"><span class="verse-num">32&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> but I prayed for you, that your faith wouldn&rsquo;t fail.

<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.22.35"><span class="verse-num">35&nbsp;</span>He said to them, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;When I sent you out without purse, and wallet, and shoes, did you lack anything?&rdquo;</span></span>

</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.22.36"><span class="verse-num">36&nbsp;</span>Then he said to them, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;But now, whoever has a purse, let him take it, and likewise a wallet. Whoever has none, let him sell his cloak, and buy a sword. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.22.37"><span class="verse-num">37&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> For I tell you that this which is written must still be fulfilled in me: &lsquo;He was counted with transgressors.&rsquo;</span>\x + Isaiah 53:12\x* <span class="woc"> For that which concerns me has an end.&rdquo;</span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.22.41"><span class="verse-num">41&nbsp;</span>He was withdrawn from them about a stone&rsquo;s throw, and he knelt down and prayed,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.22.42"><span class="verse-num">42&nbsp;</span>saying, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Father, if you are willing, remove this cup from me. Nevertheless, not my will, but yours, be done.&rdquo;</span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.22.43"><span class="verse-num">43&nbsp;</span>An angel from heaven appeared to him, strengthening him.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.22.44"><span class="verse-num">44&nbsp;</span>Being in agony he prayed more earnestly. His sweat became like great drops of blood falling down on the ground.</span>

<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.22.54"><span class="verse-num">54&nbsp;</span>They seized him, and led him away, and brought him into the high priest&rsquo;s house. But Peter followed from a distance.</span>

<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.22.58"><span class="verse-num">58&nbsp;</span>After a little while someone else saw him, and said, &ldquo;You also are one of them!&rdquo;</span>

<p>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.22.59"><span class="verse-num">59&nbsp;</span>After about one hour passed, another confidently affirmed, saying, &ldquo;Truly this man also was with him, for he is a Galilean!&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.22.60"><span class="verse-num">60&nbsp;</span>But Peter said, &ldquo;Man, I don&rsquo;t know what you are talking about!&rdquo; Immediately, while he was still speaking, a rooster crowed.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.22.61"><span class="verse-num">61&nbsp;</span>The Lord turned, and looked at Peter. Then Peter remembered the Lord&rsquo;s word, how he said to him, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Before the rooster crows you will deny me three times.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.22.62"><span class="verse-num">62&nbsp;</span>He went out, and wept bitterly.</span>

<span class="verse Luke_5_2" data-osis="Luke.5.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>He saw two boats standing by the lake, but the fishermen had gone out of them, and were washing their nets.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_5_3" data-osis="Luke.5.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>He entered into one of the boats, which was Simon&rsquo;s, and asked him to put out a little from the land. He sat down and taught the multitudes from the boat.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_5_4" data-osis="Luke.5.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>When he had finished speaking, he said to Simon, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Put out into the deep, and let down your nets for a catch.&rdquo;</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Luke_5_5" data-osis="Luke.5.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>Simon answered him, &ldquo;Master, we worked all night, and took nothing; but at your word I will let down the net.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Luke_5_6" data-osis="Luke.5.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>When they had done this, they caught a great multitude of fish, and their net was breaking.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_5_7" data-osis="Luke.5.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>They beckoned to their partners in the other boat, that they should come and help them. They came, and filled both boats, so that they began to sink.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_5_8" data-osis="Luke.5.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>But Simon Peter, when he saw it, fell down at Jesus&rsquo; knees, saying, &ldquo;Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, Lord.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Luke_5_9" data-osis="Luke.5.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>For he was amazed, and all who were with him, at the catch of fish which they had caught;</span>
<span class="verse Luke_5_10" data-osis="Luke.5.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>and so also were James and John, sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon.<br>Jesus said to Simon, \wj “Don’t be afraid. From now on you will be catching people alive.”\wj*</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Luke_5_11" data-osis="Luke.5.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>When they had brought their boats to land, they left everything, and followed him.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_5_12" data-osis="Luke.5.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>It happened, while he was in one of the cities, behold, there was a man full of leprosy. When he saw Jesus, he fell on his face, and begged him, saying, &ldquo;Lord, if you want to, you can make me clean.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Luke_5_13" data-osis="Luke.5.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>He stretched out his hand, and touched him, saying, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;I want to. Be made clean.&rdquo;</span><br>Immediately the leprosy left him.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_5_14" data-osis="Luke.5.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>He commanded him to tell no one, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;But go your way, and show yourself to the priest, and offer for your cleansing according to what Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.&rdquo;</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_5_15" data-osis="Luke.5.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>But the report concerning him spread much more, and great multitudes came together to hear, and to be healed by him of their infirmities.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_5_16" data-osis="Luke.5.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>But he withdrew himself into the desert, and prayed.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Luke_5_17" data-osis="Luke.5.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>It happened on one of those days, that he was teaching; and there were Pharisees and teachers of the law sitting by, who had come out of every village of Galilee, Judea, and Jerusalem.

<span class="verse Luke_5_18" data-osis="Luke.5.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>Behold, men brought a paralyzed man on a cot, and they sought to bring him in to lay before Jesus.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_5_19" data-osis="Luke.5.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>Not finding a way to bring him in because of the multitude, they went up to the housetop, and let him down through the tiles with his cot into the midst before Jesus.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_5_20" data-osis="Luke.5.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>Seeing their faith, he said to him, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Man, your sins are forgiven you.&rdquo;</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Luke_5_21" data-osis="Luke.5.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>The scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, &ldquo;Who is this that speaks blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, but God alone?&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Luke_5_22" data-osis="Luke.5.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>But Jesus, perceiving their thoughts, answered them, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Why are you reasoning so in your hearts? </span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_5_23" data-osis="Luke.5.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Which is easier to say, &lsquo;Your sins are forgiven you;&rsquo; or to say, &lsquo;Arise and walk?&rsquo; </span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_5_24" data-osis="Luke.5.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins&rdquo;</span> (he said to the paralyzed man), <span class="woc"> &ldquo;I tell you, arise, and take up your cot, and go to your house.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse Luke_5_25" data-osis="Luke.5.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span>Immediately he rose up before them, and took up that which he was laying on, and departed to his house, glorifying God.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_5_26" data-osis="Luke.5.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span>Amazement took hold on all, and they glorified God. They were filled with fear, saying, &ldquo;We have seen strange things today.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Luke_5_27" data-osis="Luke.5.27"><span class="verse-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span>After these things he went out, and saw a tax collector named Levi sitting at the tax office, and said to him, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Follow me!&rdquo;</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Luke_5_28" data-osis="Luke.5.28"><span class="verse-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span>He left everything, and rose up and followed him.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_5_29" data-osis="Luke.5.29"><span class="verse-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span>Levi made a great feast for him in his house. There was a great crowd of tax collectors and others who were reclining with them.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_5_30" data-osis="Luke.5.30"><span class="verse-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span>Their scribes and the Pharisees murmured against his disciples, saying, &ldquo;Why do you eat and drink with the tax collectors and sinners?&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Luke_5_31" data-osis="Luke.5.31"><span class="verse-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span>Jesus answered them, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Those who are healthy have no need for a physician, but those who are sick do. </span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_5_32" data-osis="Luke.5.32"><span class="verse-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.&rdquo; </span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Luke_5_33" data-osis="Luke.5.33"><span class="verse-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span>They said to him, &ldquo;Why do John&rsquo;s disciples often fast and pray, likewise also the disciples of the Pharisees, but yours eat and drink?&rdquo;</span>

<p>
<span class="verse Luke_5_34" data-osis="Luke.5.34"><span class="verse-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span>He said to them, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Can you make the friends of the bridegroom fast, while the bridegroom is with them? </span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_5_35" data-osis="Luke.5.35"><span class="verse-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> But the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them. Then they will fast in those days.&rdquo;</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_5_36" data-osis="Luke.5.36"><span class="verse-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span>He also told a parable to them. <span class="woc"> &ldquo;No one puts a piece from a new garment on an old garment, or else he will tear the new, and also the piece from the new will not match the old. </span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_5_37" data-osis="Luke.5.37"><span class="verse-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> No one puts new wine into old wineskins, or else the new wine will burst the skins, and it will be spilled, and the skins will be destroyed. </span></span>

<span class="verse Luke_7_7" data-osis="Luke.7.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>Therefore I didn&rsquo;t even think myself worthy to come to you; but say the word, and my servant will be healed.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_7_8" data-osis="Luke.7.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>For I also am a man placed under authority, having under myself soldiers.

<span class="verse Mark_14_7" data-osis="Mark.14.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> For you always have the poor with you, and whenever you want to, you can do them good; but you will not always have me. </span></span>

<p>
<span class="verse Mark_14_31" data-osis="Mark.14.31"><span class="verse-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span>But he spoke all the more, &ldquo;If I must die with you, I will not deny you.&rdquo; They all said the same thing.</span>

<p>
<span class="verse Mark_14_32" data-osis="Mark.14.32"><span class="verse-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span>They came to a place which was named Gethsemane. He said to his disciples, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Sit here, while I pray.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse Mark_14_36" data-osis="Mark.14.36"><span class="verse-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span>He said, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Abba, Father, all things are possible to you. Please remove this cup from me. However, not what I desire, but what you desire.&rdquo; </span></span>

<p>
<span class="verse Mark_14_37" data-osis="Mark.14.37"><span class="verse-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span>He came and found them sleeping, and said to Peter, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Simon, are you sleeping? Couldn&rsquo;t you watch one hour? </span></span>

<span class="verse Mark_14_39" data-osis="Mark.14.39"><span class="verse-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span>Again he went away, and prayed, saying the same words.</span>
<span class="verse Mark_14_40" data-osis="Mark.14.40"><span class="verse-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span>Again he returned, and found them sleeping, for their eyes were very heavy, and they didn&rsquo;t know what to answer him.</span>

<span class="verse Mark_14_42" data-osis="Mark.14.42"><span class="verse-num v-42">42&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Arise, let us be going. Behold, he who betrays me is at hand.&rdquo; </span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Mark_14_43" data-osis="Mark.14.43"><span class="verse-num v-43">43&nbsp;</span>Immediately, while he was still speaking, Judas, one of the twelve, came&mdash;and with him a multitude with swords and clubs, from the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders.</span>
<span class="verse Mark_14_44" data-osis="Mark.14.44"><span class="verse-num v-44">44&nbsp;</span>Now he who betrayed him had given them a sign, saying, &ldquo;Whomever I will kiss, that is he. Seize him, and lead him away safely.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Mark_14_45" data-osis="Mark.14.45"><span class="verse-num v-45">45&nbsp;</span>When he had come, immediately he came to him, and said, &ldquo;Rabbi! Rabbi!&rdquo; and kissed him.</span>
<span class="verse Mark_14_46" data-osis="Mark.14.46"><span class="verse-num v-46">46&nbsp;</span>They laid their hands on him, and seized him.</span>
<span class="verse Mark_14_47" data-osis="Mark.14.47"><span class="verse-num v-47">47&nbsp;</span>But a certain one of those who stood by drew his sword, and struck the servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Mark_14_48" data-osis="Mark.14.48"><span class="verse-num v-48">48&nbsp;</span>Jesus answered them, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Have you come out, as against a robber, with swords and clubs to seize me? </span></span>
<span class="verse Mark_14_49" data-osis="Mark.14.49"><span class="verse-num v-49">49&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> I was daily with you in the temple teaching, and you didn&rsquo;t arrest me. But this is so that the Scriptures might be fulfilled.&rdquo;</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Mark_14_50" data-osis="Mark.14.50"><span class="verse-num v-50">50&nbsp;</span>They all left him, and fled.</span>
<span class="verse Mark_14_51" data-osis="Mark.14.51"><span class="verse-num v-51">51&nbsp;</span>A certain young man followed him, having a linen cloth thrown around himself, over his naked body. The young men grabbed him,</span>
<span class="verse Mark_14_52" data-osis="Mark.14.52"><span class="verse-num v-52">52&nbsp;</span>but he left the linen cloth, and fled from them naked.</span>
<span class="verse Mark_14_53" data-osis="Mark.14.53"><span class="verse-num v-53">53&nbsp;</span>They led Jesus away to the high priest. All the chief priests, the elders, and the scribes came together with him.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Mark_14_54" data-osis="Mark.14.54"><span class="verse-num v-54">54&nbsp;</span>Peter had followed him from a distance, until he came into the court of the high priest. He was sitting with the officers, and warming himself in the light of the fire.</span>
<span class="verse Mark_14_55" data-osis="Mark.14.55"><span class="verse-num v-55">55&nbsp;</span>Now the chief priests and the whole council sought witnesses against Jesus to put him to death, and found none.</span>
<span class="verse Mark_14_56" data-osis="Mark.14.56"><span class="verse-num v-56">56&nbsp;</span>For many gave false testimony against him, and their testimony didn&rsquo;t agree with each other.</span>
<span class="verse Mark_14_57" data-osis="Mark.14.57"><span class="verse-num v-57">57&nbsp;</span>Some stood up, and gave false testimony against him, saying,</span>
<span class="verse Mark_14_58" data-osis="Mark.14.58"><span class="verse-num v-58">58&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;We heard him say, &lsquo;I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and in three days I will build another made without hands.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Mark_14_59" data-osis="Mark.14.59"><span class="verse-num v-59">59&nbsp;</span>Even so, their testimony did not agree.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Mark_14_60" data-osis="Mark.14.60"><span class="verse-num v-60">60&nbsp;</span>The high priest stood up in the midst, and asked Jesus, &ldquo;Have you no answer? What is it which these testify against you?&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Mark_14_61" data-osis="Mark.14.61"><span class="verse-num v-61">61&nbsp;</span>But he stayed quiet, and answered nothing. Again the high priest asked him, &ldquo;Are you the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Mark_14_62" data-osis="Mark.14.62"><span class="verse-num v-62">62&nbsp;</span>Jesus said, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;I am. You will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of Power, and coming with the clouds of the sky.&rdquo;</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Mark_14_63" data-osis="Mark.14.63"><span class="verse-num v-63">63&nbsp;</span>The high priest tore his clothes, and said, &ldquo;What further need have we of witnesses?</span>
<span class="verse Mark_14_64" data-osis="Mark.14.64"><span class="verse-num v-64">64&nbsp;</span>You have heard the blasphemy! What do you think?&rdquo; They all condemned him to be worthy of death.</span>
<span class="verse Mark_14_65" data-osis="Mark.14.65"><span class="verse-num v-65">65&nbsp;</span>Some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to beat him with fists, and to tell him, &ldquo;Prophesy!&rdquo; The officers struck him with the palms of their hands.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Mark_14_66" data-osis="Mark.14.66"><span class="verse-num v-66">66&nbsp;</span>As Peter was in the courtyard below, one of the maids of the high priest came,</span>
<span class="verse Mark_14_67" data-osis="Mark.14.67"><span class="verse-num v-67">67&nbsp;</span>and seeing Peter warming himself, she looked at him, and said, &ldquo;You were also with the Nazarene, Jesus!&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Mark_14_68" data-osis="Mark.14.68"><span class="verse-num v-68">68&nbsp;</span>But he denied it, saying, &ldquo;I neither know, nor understand what you are saying.&rdquo; He went out on the porch, and the rooster crowed.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Mark_14_69" data-osis="Mark.14.69"><span class="verse-num v-69">69&nbsp;</span>The maid saw him, and began again to tell those who stood by, &ldquo;This is one of them.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Mark_14_70" data-osis="Mark.14.70"><span class="verse-num v-70">70&nbsp;</span>But he again denied it. After a little while again those who stood by said to Peter, &ldquo;You truly are one of them, for you are a Galilean, and your speech shows it.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Mark_14_71" data-osis="Mark.14.71"><span class="verse-num v-71">71&nbsp;</span>But he began to curse, and to swear, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know this man of whom you speak!&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Mark_14_72" data-osis="Mark.14.72"><span class="verse-num v-72">72&nbsp;</span>The rooster crowed the second time. Peter remembered the word, how that Jesus said to him, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Before the rooster crows twice, you will deny me three times.&rdquo;</span> When he thought about that, he wept.</span>

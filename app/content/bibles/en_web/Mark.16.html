<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.16.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>They were saying among themselves, &ldquo;Who will roll away the stone from the door of the tomb for us?&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.16.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>for it was very big. Looking up, they saw that the stone was rolled back.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.16.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>Entering into the tomb, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, dressed in a white robe, and they were amazed.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.16.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>He said to them, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be amazed. You seek Jesus, the Nazarene, who has been crucified. He has risen. He is not here. Behold, the place where they laid him!</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.16.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>But go, tell his disciples and Peter, &lsquo;He goes before you into Galilee. There you will see him, as he said to you.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span>

<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.16.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>They went out,<span class="note">+<dfn>TR adds &ldquo;quickly&rdquo;</dfn></span> and fled from the tomb, for trembling and astonishment had come on them. They said nothing to anyone; for they were afraid.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.16.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>Now when he had risen early on the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, from whom he had cast out seven demons.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.16.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>When they heard that he was alive, and had been seen by her, they disbelieved.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.16.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>After these things he was revealed in another form to two of them, as they walked, on their way into the country.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.16.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>They went away and told it to the rest. They didn&rsquo;t believe them, either.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.16.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>Afterward he was revealed to the eleven themselves as they sat at the table, and he rebuked them for their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they didn&rsquo;t believe those who had seen him after he had risen.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.16.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>He said to them, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Go into all the world, and preach the Good News to the whole creation. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.16.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> He who believes and is baptized will be saved; but he who disbelieves will be condemned. </span></span>

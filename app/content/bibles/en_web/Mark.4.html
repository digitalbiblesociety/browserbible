<span class="verse Mark_4_26" data-osis="Mark.4.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span>He said, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;The Kingdom of God is as if a man should cast seed on the earth, </span></span>
<span class="verse Mark_4_27" data-osis="Mark.4.27"><span class="verse-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> and should sleep and rise night and day, and the seed should spring up and grow, he doesn&rsquo;t know how. </span></span>
<span class="verse Mark_4_28" data-osis="Mark.4.28"><span class="verse-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> For the earth bears fruit: first the blade, then the ear, then the full grain in the ear. </span></span>
<span class="verse Mark_4_29" data-osis="Mark.4.29"><span class="verse-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> But when the fruit is ripe, immediately he puts in the sickle, because the harvest has come.&rdquo;</span></span>

<p>
<span class="verse Mark_4_30" data-osis="Mark.4.30"><span class="verse-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span>He said, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;How will we liken the Kingdom of God? Or with what parable will we illustrate it? </span></span>
<span class="verse Mark_4_31" data-osis="Mark.4.31"><span class="verse-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> It&rsquo;s like a grain of mustard seed, which, when it is sown in the earth, though it is less than all the seeds that are on the earth, </span></span>
<span class="verse Mark_4_32" data-osis="Mark.4.32"><span class="verse-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> yet when it is sown, grows up, and becomes greater than all the herbs, and puts out great branches, so that the birds of the sky can lodge under its shadow.&rdquo;</span></span>

<p>
<span class="verse Mark_4_33" data-osis="Mark.4.33"><span class="verse-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span>With many such parables he spoke the word to them, as they were able to hear it.</span>
<span class="verse Mark_4_34" data-osis="Mark.4.34"><span class="verse-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span>Without a parable he didn&rsquo;t speak to them; but privately to his own disciples he explained everything.</span>

<p>
<span class="verse Mark_4_35" data-osis="Mark.4.35"><span class="verse-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span>On that day, when evening had come, he said to them, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go over to the other side.&rdquo;</span></span>
<span class="verse Mark_4_36" data-osis="Mark.4.36"><span class="verse-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span>Leaving the multitude, they took him with them, even as he was, in the boat. Other small boats were also with him.</span>
<span class="verse Mark_4_37" data-osis="Mark.4.37"><span class="verse-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span>A big wind storm arose, and the waves beat into the boat, so much that the boat was already filled.</span>
<span class="verse Mark_4_38" data-osis="Mark.4.38"><span class="verse-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span>He himself was in the stern, asleep on the cushion, and they woke him up, and told him, &ldquo;Teacher, don&rsquo;t you care that we are dying?&rdquo;</span>

<p>
<span class="verse Mark_4_39" data-osis="Mark.4.39"><span class="verse-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span>He awoke, and rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Peace! Be still!&rdquo;</span> The wind ceased, and there was a great calm.</span>
<span class="verse Mark_4_40" data-osis="Mark.4.40"><span class="verse-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span>He said to them, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Why are you so afraid? How is it that you have no faith?&rdquo;</span></span>

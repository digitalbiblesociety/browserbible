<span class="verse Mark_8_1" data-osis="Mark.8.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>In those days, when there was a very great multitude, and they had nothing to eat, Jesus called his disciples to himself, and said to them,</span>
<span class="verse Mark_8_2" data-osis="Mark.8.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;I have compassion on the multitude, because they have stayed with me now three days, and have nothing to eat. </span></span>
<span class="verse Mark_8_3" data-osis="Mark.8.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> If I send them away fasting to their home, they will faint on the way, for some of them have come a long way.&rdquo;</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Mark_8_4" data-osis="Mark.8.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>His disciples answered him, &ldquo;From where could one satisfy these people with bread here in a deserted place?&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Mark_8_5" data-osis="Mark.8.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>He asked them, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;How many loaves do you have?&rdquo;</span></span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Mark_8_6" data-osis="Mark.8.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>He commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground, and he took the seven loaves. Having given thanks, he broke them, and gave them to his disciples to serve, and they served the multitude.</span>
<span class="verse Mark_8_7" data-osis="Mark.8.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>They had a few small fish. Having blessed them, he said to serve these also.</span>
<span class="verse Mark_8_8" data-osis="Mark.8.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>They ate, and were filled. They took up seven baskets of broken pieces that were left over.</span>
<span class="verse Mark_8_9" data-osis="Mark.8.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>Those who had eaten were about four thousand. Then he sent them away.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Mark_8_10" data-osis="Mark.8.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>Immediately he entered into the boat with his disciples, and came into the region of Dalmanutha.</span>
<span class="verse Mark_8_11" data-osis="Mark.8.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>The Pharisees came out and began to question him, seeking from him a sign from heaven, and testing him.</span>
<span class="verse Mark_8_12" data-osis="Mark.8.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>He sighed deeply in his spirit, and said, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Why does this generation </span><span class="note">+<dfn>The word translated &ldquo;generation&rdquo; here (genea) could also be translated &ldquo;people,&rdquo; &ldquo;race,&rdquo; or &ldquo;family.&rdquo;</dfn></span><span class="woc"> seek a sign? Most certainly I tell you, no sign will be given to this generation.&rdquo;</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Mark_8_13" data-osis="Mark.8.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>He left them, and again entering into the boat, departed to the other side.</span>
<span class="verse Mark_8_14" data-osis="Mark.8.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>They forgot to take bread; and they didn&rsquo;t have more than one loaf in the boat with them.</span>
<span class="verse Mark_8_15" data-osis="Mark.8.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>He warned them, saying, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Take heed: beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and the yeast of Herod.&rdquo;</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Mark_8_16" data-osis="Mark.8.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>They reasoned with one another, saying, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s because we have no bread.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Mark_8_17" data-osis="Mark.8.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>Jesus, perceiving it, said to them, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Why do you reason that it&rsquo;s because you have no bread? Don&rsquo;t you perceive yet, neither understand? Is your heart still hardened? </span></span>
<span class="verse Mark_8_18" data-osis="Mark.8.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Having eyes, don&rsquo;t you see? Having ears, don&rsquo;t you hear? Don&rsquo;t you remember? </span></span>
<span class="verse Mark_8_19" data-osis="Mark.8.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> When I broke the five loaves among the five thousand, how many baskets full of broken pieces did you take up?&rdquo;</span></span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Mark_8_20" data-osis="Mark.8.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;When the seven loaves fed the four thousand, how many baskets full of broken pieces did you take up?&rdquo;</span></span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Mark_8_21" data-osis="Mark.8.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>He asked them, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you understand, yet?&rdquo;</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Mark_8_22" data-osis="Mark.8.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>He came to Bethsaida. They brought a blind man to him, and begged him to touch him.</span>
<span class="verse Mark_8_23" data-osis="Mark.8.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>He took hold of the blind man by the hand, and brought him out of the village. When he had spit on his eyes, and laid his hands on him, he asked him if he saw anything.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Mark_8_24" data-osis="Mark.8.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span>He looked up, and said, &ldquo;I see men; for I see them like trees walking.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Mark_8_25" data-osis="Mark.8.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span>Then again he laid his hands on his eyes. He looked intently, and was restored, and saw everyone clearly.</span>
<span class="verse Mark_8_26" data-osis="Mark.8.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span>He sent him away to his house, saying, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t enter into the village, nor tell anyone in the village.&rdquo;</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Mark_8_27" data-osis="Mark.8.27"><span class="verse-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span>Jesus went out, with his disciples, into the villages of Caesarea Philippi. On the way he asked his disciples, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Who do men say that I am?&rdquo; </span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Mark_8_28" data-osis="Mark.8.28"><span class="verse-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span>They told him, &ldquo;John the Baptizer, and others say Elijah, but others: one of the prophets.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Mark_8_29" data-osis="Mark.8.29"><span class="verse-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span>He said to them, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;But who do you say that I am?&rdquo;</span></span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Mark_8_30" data-osis="Mark.8.30"><span class="verse-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span>He commanded them that they should tell no one about him.</span>
<span class="verse Mark_8_31" data-osis="Mark.8.31"><span class="verse-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span>He began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders, the chief priests, and the scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again.</span>
<span class="verse Mark_8_32" data-osis="Mark.8.32"><span class="verse-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span>He spoke to them openly. Peter took him, and began to rebuke him.</span>
<span class="verse Mark_8_33" data-osis="Mark.8.33"><span class="verse-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span>But he, turning around, and seeing his disciples, rebuked Peter, and said, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Get behind me, Satan! For you have in mind not the things of God, but the things of men.&rdquo;</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Mark_8_34" data-osis="Mark.8.34"><span class="verse-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span>He called the multitude to himself with his disciples, and said to them,</span>
<span class="verse Mark_8_35" data-osis="Mark.8.35"><span class="verse-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> For whoever wants to save his life will lose it; and whoever will lose his life for my sake and the sake of the Good News will save it. </span></span>
<span class="verse Mark_8_36" data-osis="Mark.8.36"><span class="verse-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> For what does it profit a man, to gain the whole world, and forfeit his life? </span></span>
<span class="verse Mark_8_37" data-osis="Mark.8.37"><span class="verse-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> For what will a man give in exchange for his life? </span></span>
<span class="verse Mark_8_38" data-osis="Mark.8.38"><span class="verse-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> For whoever will be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, the Son of Man also will be ashamed of him, when he comes in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.&rdquo;</span></span>

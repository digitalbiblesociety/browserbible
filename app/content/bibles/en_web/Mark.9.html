<span class="verse Mark_9_1" data-osis="Mark.9.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>He said to them, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Most certainly I tell you, there are some standing here who will in no way taste death until they see the Kingdom of God come with power.&rdquo;</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Mark_9_2" data-osis="Mark.9.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>After six days Jesus took with him Peter, James, and John, and brought them up onto a high mountain privately by themselves, and he was changed into another form in front of them.</span>
<span class="verse Mark_9_3" data-osis="Mark.9.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>His clothing became glistening, exceedingly white, like snow, such as no launderer on earth can whiten them.</span>
<span class="verse Mark_9_4" data-osis="Mark.9.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>Elijah and Moses appeared to them, and they were talking with Jesus.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Mark_9_5" data-osis="Mark.9.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>Peter answered Jesus, &ldquo;Rabbi, it is good for us to be here. Let&rsquo;s make three tents: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Mark_9_6" data-osis="Mark.9.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>For he didn&rsquo;t know what to say, for they were very afraid.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Mark_9_7" data-osis="Mark.9.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>A cloud came, overshadowing them, and a voice came out of the cloud, &ldquo;This is my beloved Son. Listen to him.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Mark_9_8" data-osis="Mark.9.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>Suddenly looking around, they saw no one with them any more, except Jesus only.</span>

<span class="verse Mark_9_9" data-osis="Mark.9.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>As they were coming down from the mountain, he commanded them that they should tell no one what things they had seen, until after the Son of Man had risen from the dead.</span>
<span class="verse Mark_9_10" data-osis="Mark.9.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>They kept this saying to themselves, questioning what the &ldquo;rising from the dead&rdquo; meant.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Mark_9_11" data-osis="Mark.9.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>They asked him, saying, &ldquo;Why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Mark_9_12" data-osis="Mark.9.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>He said to them, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Elijah indeed comes first, and restores all things. How is it written about the Son of Man, that he should suffer many things and be despised? </span></span>
<span class="verse Mark_9_13" data-osis="Mark.9.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> But I tell you that Elijah has come, and they have also done to him whatever they wanted to, even as it is written about him.&rdquo;</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Mark_9_14" data-osis="Mark.9.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>Coming to the disciples, he saw a great multitude around them, and scribes questioning them.</span>
<span class="verse Mark_9_15" data-osis="Mark.9.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>Immediately all the multitude, when they saw him, were greatly amazed, and running to him greeted him.</span>

<p>
<span class="verse Mark_9_17" data-osis="Mark.9.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>One of the multitude answered, &ldquo;Teacher, I brought to you my son, who has a mute spirit;</span>
<span class="verse Mark_9_18" data-osis="Mark.9.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>and wherever it seizes him, it throws him down, and he foams at the mouth, and grinds his teeth, and wastes away. I asked your disciples to cast it out, and they weren&rsquo;t able.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Mark_9_19" data-osis="Mark.9.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>He answered him, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Unbelieving generation, how long shall I be with you? How long shall I bear with you? Bring him to me.&rdquo;</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Mark_9_20" data-osis="Mark.9.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>They brought him to him, and when he saw him, immediately the spirit convulsed him, and he fell on the ground, wallowing and foaming at the mouth.</span>

<p>
<span class="verse Mark_9_22" data-osis="Mark.9.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>Often it has cast him both into the fire and into the water, to destroy him. But if you can do anything, have compassion on us, and help us.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Mark_9_23" data-osis="Mark.9.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>Jesus said to him, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;If you can believe, all things are possible to him who believes.&rdquo;</span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Mark_9_26" data-osis="Mark.9.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span>Having cried out, and convulsed greatly, it came out of him. The boy became like one dead; so much that most of them said, &ldquo;He is dead.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Mark_9_27" data-osis="Mark.9.27"><span class="verse-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span>But Jesus took him by the hand, and raised him up; and he arose.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Mark_9_28" data-osis="Mark.9.28"><span class="verse-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span>When he had come into the house, his disciples asked him privately, &ldquo;Why couldn&rsquo;t we cast it out?&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Mark_9_29" data-osis="Mark.9.29"><span class="verse-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span>He said to them, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;This kind can come out by nothing, except by prayer and fasting.&rdquo;</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Mark_9_30" data-osis="Mark.9.30"><span class="verse-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span>They went out from there, and passed through Galilee. He didn&rsquo;t want anyone to know it.</span>
<span class="verse Mark_9_31" data-osis="Mark.9.31"><span class="verse-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span>For he was teaching his disciples, and said to them, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;The Son of Man is being handed over to the hands of men, and they will kill him; and when he is killed, on the third day he will rise again.&rdquo;</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Mark_9_32" data-osis="Mark.9.32"><span class="verse-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span>But they didn&rsquo;t understand the saying, and were afraid to ask him.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Mark_9_33" data-osis="Mark.9.33"><span class="verse-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span>He came to Capernaum, and when he was in the house he asked them, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;What were you arguing among yourselves on the way?&rdquo;</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Mark_9_34" data-osis="Mark.9.34"><span class="verse-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span>But they were silent, for they had disputed one with another on the way about who was the greatest.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Mark_9_35" data-osis="Mark.9.35"><span class="verse-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span>He sat down, and called the twelve; and he said to them, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;If any man wants to be first, he shall be last of all, and servant of all.&rdquo;</span></span>
<span class="verse Mark_9_36" data-osis="Mark.9.36"><span class="verse-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span>He took a little child, and set him in their midst. Taking him in his arms, he said to them,</span>
<span class="verse Mark_9_37" data-osis="Mark.9.37"><span class="verse-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;Whoever receives one such little child in my name, receives me, and whoever receives me, doesn&rsquo;t receive me, but him who sent me.&rdquo;</span></span>

<p>
<span class="verse Mark_9_38" data-osis="Mark.9.38"><span class="verse-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span>John said to him, &ldquo;Teacher, we saw someone who doesn&rsquo;t follow us casting out demons in your name; and we forbade him, because he doesn&rsquo;t follow us.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Mark_9_39" data-osis="Mark.9.39"><span class="verse-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span>But Jesus said, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forbid him, for there is no one who will do a mighty work in my name, and be able quickly to speak evil of me. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.16.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> An evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign, and there will be no sign given to it, except the sign of the prophet Jonah.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.16.19"><span class="verse-num">19&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> I will give to you the keys of the Kingdom of Heaven, and whatever you bind on earth will have been bound in heaven; and whatever you release on earth will have been released in heaven.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.16.20"><span class="verse-num">20&nbsp;</span>Then he commanded the disciples that they should tell no one that he was Jesus the Christ.</span>

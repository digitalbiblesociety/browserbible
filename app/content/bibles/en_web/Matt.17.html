<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.17.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>He was transfigured before them. His face shone like the sun, and his garments became as white as the light.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.17.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>Behold, Moses and Elijah appeared to them talking with him.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.17.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>Peter answered, and said to Jesus, &ldquo;Lord, it is good for us to be here. If you want, let&rsquo;s make three tents here: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.17.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>While he was still speaking, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them. Behold, a voice came out of the cloud, saying, &ldquo;This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. Listen to him.&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.17.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>When the disciples heard it, they fell on their faces, and were very afraid.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.17.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>Jesus came and touched them and said, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Get up, and don&rsquo;t be afraid.&rdquo; </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.17.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>Lifting up their eyes, they saw no one, except Jesus alone.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.17.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>His disciples asked him, saying, &ldquo;Then why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.17.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>Jesus answered them, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Elijah indeed comes first, and will restore all things, </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.17.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> but I tell you that Elijah has come already, and they didn&rsquo;t recognize him, but did to him whatever they wanted to. Even so the Son of Man will also suffer by them.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.17.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>Then the disciples understood that he spoke to them of John the Baptizer.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.17.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>When they came to the multitude, a man came to him, kneeling down to him, saying,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.17.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Lord, have mercy on my son, for he is epileptic, and suffers grievously; for he often falls into the fire, and often into the water.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.17.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span>So I brought him to your disciples, and they could not cure him.&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.17.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span>Jesus answered, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Faithless and perverse generation! How long will I be with you? How long will I bear with you? Bring him here to me.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.17.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span>Jesus rebuked him, the demon went out of him, and the boy was cured from that hour.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.17.19"><span class="verse-num">19&nbsp;</span>Then the disciples came to Jesus privately, and said, &ldquo;Why weren&rsquo;t we able to cast it out?&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.17.20"><span class="verse-num">20&nbsp;</span>He said to them, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Because of your unbelief. For most certainly I tell you, if you have faith as a grain of mustard seed, you will tell this mountain, &lsquo;Move from here to there,&rsquo; and it will move; and nothing will be impossible for you. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.17.21"><span class="verse-num">21&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> But this kind doesn&rsquo;t go out except by prayer and fasting.&rdquo; </span></span>

<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.17.22"><span class="verse-num">22&nbsp;</span>While they were staying in Galilee, Jesus said to them, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;The Son of Man is about to be delivered up into the hands of men, </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.17.23"><span class="verse-num">23&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> and they will kill him, and the third day he will be raised up.&rdquo; </span></span>

<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.17.24"><span class="verse-num">24&nbsp;</span>When they had come to Capernaum, those who collected the didrachma coins<span class="note">+<dfn>A didrachma is a Greek silver coin worth 2 drachmas, about as much as 2 Roman denarii, or about 2 days&rsquo; wages. It was commonly used to pay the half-shekel temple tax, because 2 drachmas were worth one half shekel of silver.</dfn></span> came to Peter, and said, &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t your teacher pay the didrachma?&rdquo;</span>

When you have opened its mouth, you will find a stater coin.</span><span class="note">+<dfn>A stater is a silver coin equivalent to four Attic or two Alexandrian drachmas, or a Jewish shekel: just exactly enough to cover the half-shekel temple tax for two people.</dfn></span><span class="woc"> Take that, and give it to them for me and you.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.22.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>Jesus answered and spoke again in parables to them, saying,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.22.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;The Kingdom of Heaven is like a certain king, who made a marriage feast for his son, </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.22.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> and sent out his servants to call those who were invited to the marriage feast, but they would not come. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.22.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Again he sent out other servants, saying, &lsquo;Tell those who are invited, &ldquo;Behold, I have prepared my dinner. My cattle and my fatlings are killed, and all things are ready. Come to the marriage feast!&rdquo;&rsquo; </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.22.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> But they made light of it, and went their ways, one to his own farm, another to his merchandise, </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.22.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> and the rest grabbed his servants, and treated them shamefully, and killed them. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.22.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> When the king heard that, he was angry, and sent his armies, destroyed those murderers, and burned their city.</span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.22.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;Then he said to his servants, &lsquo;The wedding is ready, but those who were invited weren&rsquo;t worthy. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.22.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Go therefore to the intersections of the highways, and as many as you may find, invite to the marriage feast.&rsquo; </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.22.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Those servants went out into the highways, and gathered together as many as they found, both bad and good. The wedding was filled with guests. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.22.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> But when the king came in to see the guests, he saw there a man who didn&rsquo;t have on wedding clothing, </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.22.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> and he said to him, &lsquo;Friend, how did you come in here not wearing wedding clothing?&rsquo; He was speechless. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.22.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Then the king said to the servants, &lsquo;Bind him hand and foot, take him away, and throw him into the outer darkness; there is where the weeping and grinding of teeth will be.&rsquo; </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.22.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> For many are called, but few chosen.&rdquo;</span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.22.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>Then the Pharisees went and took counsel how they might entrap him in his talk.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.22.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span>They sent their disciples to him, along with the Herodians, saying, &ldquo;Teacher, we know that you are honest, and teach the way of God in truth, no matter whom you teach, for you aren&rsquo;t partial to anyone.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.22.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span>Tell us therefore, what do you think? Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.22.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span>But Jesus perceived their wickedness, and said, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Why do you test me, you hypocrites? </span></span>

<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.22.20"><span class="verse-num">20&nbsp;</span>He asked them, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Whose is this image and inscription?&rdquo;</span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.22.21"><span class="verse-num">21&nbsp;</span>They said to him, &ldquo;Caesar&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</span>

<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.22.22"><span class="verse-num">22&nbsp;</span>When they heard it, they marveled, and left him, and went away.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.22.23"><span class="verse-num">23&nbsp;</span>On that day Sadducees (those who say that there is no resurrection) came to him. They asked him,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.22.24"><span class="verse-num">24&nbsp;</span>saying, &ldquo;Teacher, Moses said, &lsquo;If a man dies, having no children, his brother shall marry his wife, and raise up seed for his brother.&rsquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.22.25"><span class="verse-num">25&nbsp;</span>Now there were with us seven brothers. The first married and died, and having no seed left his wife to his brother.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.22.26"><span class="verse-num">26&nbsp;</span>In the same way, the second also, and the third, to the seventh.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.22.27"><span class="verse-num">27&nbsp;</span>After them all, the woman died.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.22.28"><span class="verse-num">28&nbsp;</span>In the resurrection therefore, whose wife will she be of the seven? For they all had her.&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.22.29"><span class="verse-num">29&nbsp;</span>But Jesus answered them, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;You are mistaken, not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of God. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.22.30"><span class="verse-num">30&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> For in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are like God&rsquo;s angels in heaven. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.22.31"><span class="verse-num">31&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> But concerning the resurrection of the dead, haven&rsquo;t you read that which was spoken to you by God, saying, </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.22.32"><span class="verse-num">32&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &lsquo;I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?&rsquo;</span>\x + Exodus 3:6\x*<span class="woc"> God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.&rdquo;</span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.22.33"><span class="verse-num">33&nbsp;</span>When the multitudes heard it, they were astonished at his teaching.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.22.34"><span class="verse-num">34&nbsp;</span>But the Pharisees, when they heard that he had silenced the Sadducees, gathered themselves together.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.22.35"><span class="verse-num">35&nbsp;</span>One of them, a lawyer, asked him a question, testing him.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.22.36"><span class="verse-num">36&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the law?&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.22.37"><span class="verse-num">37&nbsp;</span>Jesus said to him, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;&lsquo;You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind.&rsquo;</span>\x + Deuteronomy 6:5 \x*</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.22.38"><span class="verse-num">38&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> This is the first and great commandment. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.22.39"><span class="verse-num">39&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> A second likewise is this, &lsquo;You shall love your neighbor as yourself.&rsquo;</span>\x + Leviticus 19:18\x*</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.22.40"><span class="verse-num">40&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> The whole law and the prophets depend on these two commandments.&rdquo; </span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.22.41"><span class="verse-num">41&nbsp;</span>Now while the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them a question,</span>

</p>
<p>

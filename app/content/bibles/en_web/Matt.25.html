<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.25.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;Then the Kingdom of Heaven will be like ten virgins, who took their lamps, and went out to meet the bridegroom. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.25.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Five of them were foolish, and five were wise. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.25.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Those who were foolish, when they took their lamps, took no oil with them, </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.25.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.25.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Now while the bridegroom delayed, they all slumbered and slept. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.25.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> But at midnight there was a cry, &lsquo;Behold! The bridegroom is coming! Come out to meet him!&rsquo; </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.25.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps.</span><span class="note">+<dfn>The end of the wick of an oil lamp needs to be cut off periodically to avoid having it become clogged with carbon deposits. The wick height is also adjusted so that the flame burns evenly and gives good light without producing a lot of smoke.</dfn></span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.25.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> The foolish said to the wise, &lsquo;Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going out.&rsquo; </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.25.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> But the wise answered, saying, &lsquo;What if there isn&rsquo;t enough for us and you? You go rather to those who sell, and buy for yourselves.&rsquo; </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.25.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> While they went away to buy, the bridegroom came, and those who were ready went in with him to the marriage feast, and the door was shut. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.25.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Afterward the other virgins also came, saying, &lsquo;Lord, Lord, open to us.&rsquo; </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.25.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> But he answered, &lsquo;Most certainly I tell you, I don&rsquo;t know you.&rsquo; </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.25.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Watch therefore, for you don&rsquo;t know the day nor the hour in which the Son of Man is coming.</span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.25.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;For it is like a man, going into another country, who called his own servants, and entrusted his goods to them. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.25.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> To one he gave five talents, to another two, to another one; to each according to his own ability. Then he went on his journey. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.25.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Immediately he who received the five talents went and traded with them, and made another five talents. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.25.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> In the same way, he also who got the two gained another two. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.25.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> But he who received the one went away and dug in the earth, and hid his lord&rsquo;s money.</span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.25.19"><span class="verse-num">19&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;Now after a long time the lord of those servants came, and reconciled accounts with them. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.25.20"><span class="verse-num">20&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> He who received the five talents came and brought another five talents, saying, &lsquo;Lord, you delivered to me five talents. Behold, I have gained another five talents besides them.&rsquo;</span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.25.21"><span class="verse-num">21&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;His lord said to him, &lsquo;Well done, good and faithful servant. You have been faithful over a few things, I will set you over many things. Enter into the joy of your lord.&rsquo;</span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.25.22"><span class="verse-num">22&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;He also who got the two talents came and said, &lsquo;Lord, you delivered to me two talents. Behold, I have gained another two talents besides them.&rsquo; </span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.25.23"><span class="verse-num">23&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;His lord said to him, &lsquo;Well done, good and faithful servant.

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.25.24"><span class="verse-num">24&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;He also who had received the one talent came and said, &lsquo;Lord, I knew you that you are a hard man, reaping where you did not sow, and gathering where you did not scatter. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.25.25"><span class="verse-num">25&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> I was afraid, and went away and hid your talent in the earth. Behold, you have what is yours.&rsquo;</span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.25.26"><span class="verse-num">26&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;But his lord answered him, &lsquo;You wicked and slothful servant. You knew that I reap where I didn&rsquo;t sow, and gather where I didn&rsquo;t scatter. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.25.27"><span class="verse-num">27&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> You ought therefore to have deposited my money with the bankers, and at my coming I should have received back my own with interest. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.25.28"><span class="verse-num">28&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Take away therefore the talent from him, and give it to him who has the ten talents. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.25.29"><span class="verse-num">29&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> For to everyone who has will be given, and he will have abundance, but from him who doesn&rsquo;t have, even that which he has will be taken away. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.25.30"><span class="verse-num">30&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Throw out the unprofitable servant into the outer darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.&rsquo;</span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.25.31"><span class="verse-num">31&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;But when the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then he will sit on the throne of his glory. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.25.32"><span class="verse-num">32&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Before him all the nations will be gathered, and he will separate them one from another, as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.25.33"><span class="verse-num">33&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> He will set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.25.34"><span class="verse-num">34&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Then the King will tell those on his right hand, &lsquo;Come, blessed of my Father, inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world; </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.25.35"><span class="verse-num">35&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> for I was hungry, and you gave me food to eat. I was thirsty, and you gave me drink. I was a stranger, and you took me in. </span></span>

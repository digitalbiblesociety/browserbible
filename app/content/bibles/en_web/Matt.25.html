<span class="verse Matt_25_1" data-osis="Matt.25.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;Then the Kingdom of Heaven will be like ten virgins, who took their lamps, and went out to meet the bridegroom. </span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_25_2" data-osis="Matt.25.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Five of them were foolish, and five were wise. </span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_25_3" data-osis="Matt.25.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Those who were foolish, when they took their lamps, took no oil with them, </span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_25_4" data-osis="Matt.25.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps. </span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_25_5" data-osis="Matt.25.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Now while the bridegroom delayed, they all slumbered and slept. </span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_25_6" data-osis="Matt.25.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> But at midnight there was a cry, &lsquo;Behold! The bridegroom is coming! Come out to meet him!&rsquo; </span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_25_7" data-osis="Matt.25.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps.</span><span class="note">+<dfn>The end of the wick of an oil lamp needs to be cut off periodically to avoid having it become clogged with carbon deposits. The wick height is also adjusted so that the flame burns evenly and gives good light without producing a lot of smoke.</dfn></span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_25_8" data-osis="Matt.25.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> The foolish said to the wise, &lsquo;Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going out.&rsquo; </span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_25_9" data-osis="Matt.25.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> But the wise answered, saying, &lsquo;What if there isn&rsquo;t enough for us and you? You go rather to those who sell, and buy for yourselves.&rsquo; </span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_25_10" data-osis="Matt.25.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> While they went away to buy, the bridegroom came, and those who were ready went in with him to the marriage feast, and the door was shut. </span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_25_11" data-osis="Matt.25.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Afterward the other virgins also came, saying, &lsquo;Lord, Lord, open to us.&rsquo; </span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_25_12" data-osis="Matt.25.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> But he answered, &lsquo;Most certainly I tell you, I don&rsquo;t know you.&rsquo; </span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_25_13" data-osis="Matt.25.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Watch therefore, for you don&rsquo;t know the day nor the hour in which the Son of Man is coming.</span></span>

<p>
<span class="verse Matt_25_14" data-osis="Matt.25.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;For it is like a man, going into another country, who called his own servants, and entrusted his goods to them. </span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_25_15" data-osis="Matt.25.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> To one he gave five talents, to another two, to another one; to each according to his own ability. Then he went on his journey. </span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_25_16" data-osis="Matt.25.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Immediately he who received the five talents went and traded with them, and made another five talents. </span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_25_17" data-osis="Matt.25.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> In the same way, he also who got the two gained another two. </span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_25_18" data-osis="Matt.25.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> But he who received the one went away and dug in the earth, and hid his lord&rsquo;s money.</span></span>

<span class="verse Matt_25_24" data-osis="Matt.25.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;He also who had received the one talent came and said, &lsquo;Lord, I knew you that you are a hard man, reaping where you did not sow, and gathering where you did not scatter. </span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_25_25" data-osis="Matt.25.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> I was afraid, and went away and hid your talent in the earth. Behold, you have what is yours.&rsquo;</span></span>

<p>
<span class="verse Matt_25_26" data-osis="Matt.25.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;But his lord answered him, &lsquo;You wicked and slothful servant. You knew that I reap where I didn&rsquo;t sow, and gather where I didn&rsquo;t scatter. </span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_25_27" data-osis="Matt.25.27"><span class="verse-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> You ought therefore to have deposited my money with the bankers, and at my coming I should have received back my own with interest. </span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_25_28" data-osis="Matt.25.28"><span class="verse-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Take away therefore the talent from him, and give it to him who has the ten talents. </span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_25_29" data-osis="Matt.25.29"><span class="verse-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> For to everyone who has will be given, and he will have abundance, but from him who doesn&rsquo;t have, even that which he has will be taken away. </span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_25_30" data-osis="Matt.25.30"><span class="verse-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Throw out the unprofitable servant into the outer darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.&rsquo;</span></span>

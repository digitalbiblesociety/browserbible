</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.27.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>Now when morning had come, all the chief priests and the elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death:</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.27.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>and they bound him, and led him away, and delivered him up to Pontius Pilate, the governor.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.27.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>Then Judas, who betrayed him, when he saw that Jesus was condemned, felt remorse, and brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.27.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>saying, &ldquo;I have sinned in that I betrayed innocent blood.&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.27.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>He threw down the pieces of silver in the sanctuary, and departed. He went away and hanged himself.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.27.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>The chief priests took the pieces of silver, and said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not lawful to put them into the treasury, since it is the price of blood.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.27.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>They took counsel, and bought the potter&rsquo;s field with them, to bury strangers in.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.27.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>Therefore that field was called &ldquo;The Field of Blood&rdquo; to this day.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.27.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>Then that which was spoken through Jeremiah<span class="note">+<dfn>some manuscripts omit &ldquo;Jeremiah&rdquo;</dfn></span> the prophet was fulfilled, saying,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.27.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>and they gave them for the potter&rsquo;s field,</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.27.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>Now Jesus stood before the governor: and the governor asked him, saying, &ldquo;Are you the King of the Jews?&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.27.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>When he was accused by the chief priests and elders, he answered nothing.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.27.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>Then Pilate said to him, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you hear how many things they testify against you?&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.27.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>He gave him no answer, not even one word, so that the governor marveled greatly.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.27.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>Now at the feast the governor was accustomed to release to the multitude one prisoner, whom they desired.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.27.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span>They had then a notable prisoner, called Barabbas.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.27.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span>When therefore they were gathered together, Pilate said to them, &ldquo;Whom do you want me to release to you? Barabbas, or Jesus, who is called Christ?&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.27.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span>For he knew that because of envy they had delivered him up.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.27.19"><span class="verse-num">19&nbsp;</span>While he was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent to him, saying, &ldquo;Have nothing to do with that righteous man, for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.27.20"><span class="verse-num">20&nbsp;</span>Now the chief priests and the elders persuaded the multitudes to ask for Barabbas, and destroy Jesus.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.27.21"><span class="verse-num">21&nbsp;</span>But the governor answered them, &ldquo;Which of the two do you want me to release to you?&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.27.22"><span class="verse-num">22&nbsp;</span>Pilate said to them, &ldquo;What then shall I do to Jesus, who is called Christ?&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.27.23"><span class="verse-num">23&nbsp;</span>But the governor said, &ldquo;Why? What evil has he done?&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.27.24"><span class="verse-num">24&nbsp;</span>So when Pilate saw that nothing was being gained, but rather that a disturbance was starting, he took water, and washed his hands before the multitude, saying, &ldquo;I am innocent of the blood of this righteous person. You see to it.&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.27.25"><span class="verse-num">25&nbsp;</span>All the people answered, &ldquo;May his blood be on us, and on our children!&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.27.26"><span class="verse-num">26&nbsp;</span>Then he released to them Barabbas, but Jesus he flogged and delivered to be crucified.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.27.27"><span class="verse-num">27&nbsp;</span>Then the governor&rsquo;s soldiers took Jesus into the Praetorium, and gathered the whole garrison together against him.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.27.28"><span class="verse-num">28&nbsp;</span>They stripped him, and put a scarlet robe on him.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.27.29"><span class="verse-num">29&nbsp;</span>They braided a crown of thorns and put it on his head, and a reed in his right hand; and they kneeled down before him, and mocked him, saying, &ldquo;Hail, King of the Jews!&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.27.30"><span class="verse-num">30&nbsp;</span>They spat on him, and took the reed and struck him on the head.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.27.31"><span class="verse-num">31&nbsp;</span>When they had mocked him, they took the robe off of him, and put his clothes on him, and led him away to crucify him.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.27.32"><span class="verse-num">32&nbsp;</span>As they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name, and they compelled him to go with them, that he might carry his cross.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.27.33"><span class="verse-num">33&nbsp;</span>They came to a place called &ldquo;Golgotha,&rdquo; that is to say, &ldquo;The place of a skull.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.27.34"><span class="verse-num">34&nbsp;</span>They gave him sour wine<span class="note">+<dfn>or, vinegar</dfn></span> to drink mixed with gall. When he had tasted it, he would not drink.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.27.35"><span class="verse-num">35&nbsp;</span>When they had crucified him, they divided his clothing among them, casting lots,<span class="note">+<dfn>TR adds &ldquo;that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet: &lsquo;They divided my garments among them, and for my clothing they cast lots;&rsquo;&rdquo; [see Psalm 22:18 and John 19:24]</dfn></span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.27.36"><span class="verse-num">36&nbsp;</span>and they sat and watched him there.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.27.37"><span class="verse-num">37&nbsp;</span>They set up over his head the accusation against him written, &ldquo;THIS IS JESUS, THE KING OF THE JEWS.&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.27.38"><span class="verse-num">38&nbsp;</span>Then there were two robbers crucified with him, one on his right hand and one on the left.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.27.39"><span class="verse-num">39&nbsp;</span>Those who passed by blasphemed him, wagging their heads,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.27.40"><span class="verse-num">40&nbsp;</span>and saying, &ldquo;You who destroy the temple, and build it in three days, save yourself! If you are the Son of God, come down from the cross!&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.27.41"><span class="verse-num">41&nbsp;</span>Likewise the chief priests also mocking, with the scribes, the Pharisees,<span class="note">+<dfn>TR omits &ldquo;the Pharisees&rdquo;</dfn></span> and the elders, said,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.27.42"><span class="verse-num">42&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;He saved others, but he can&rsquo;t save himself. If he is the King of Israel, let him come down from the cross now, and we will believe in him.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.27.43"><span class="verse-num">43&nbsp;</span>He trusts in God. Let God deliver him now, if he wants him; for he said, &lsquo;I am the Son of God.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.27.44"><span class="verse-num">44&nbsp;</span>The robbers also who were crucified with him cast on him the same reproach.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.27.45"><span class="verse-num">45&nbsp;</span>Now from the sixth hour<span class="note">+<dfn>noon</dfn></span> there was darkness over all the land until the ninth hour.<span class="note">+<dfn>3:00 P. M.</dfn></span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.27.46"><span class="verse-num">46&nbsp;</span>About the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Eli, Eli, lima</span><span class="note">+<dfn>TR reads &ldquo;lama&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;lima&rdquo;</dfn></span><span class="woc"> sabachthani?&rdquo; </span> That is, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?&rdquo;</span>\x + Psalm 22:1\x*</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.27.47"><span class="verse-num">47&nbsp;</span>Some of them who stood there, when they heard it, said, &ldquo;This man is calling Elijah.&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.27.48"><span class="verse-num">48&nbsp;</span>Immediately one of them ran, and took a sponge, and filled it with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him a drink.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.27.49"><span class="verse-num">49&nbsp;</span>The rest said, &ldquo;Let him be. Let&rsquo;s see whether Elijah comes to save him.&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.27.50"><span class="verse-num">50&nbsp;</span>Jesus cried again with a loud voice, and yielded up his spirit.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.27.51"><span class="verse-num">51&nbsp;</span>Behold, the veil of the temple was torn in two from the top to the bottom. The earth quaked and the rocks were split.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.27.52"><span class="verse-num">52&nbsp;</span>The tombs were opened, and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.27.53"><span class="verse-num">53&nbsp;</span>and coming out of the tombs after his resurrection, they entered into the holy city and appeared to many.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.27.54"><span class="verse-num">54&nbsp;</span>Now the centurion, and those who were with him watching Jesus, when they saw the earthquake, and the things that were done, feared exceedingly, saying, &ldquo;Truly this was the Son of God.&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.27.55"><span class="verse-num">55&nbsp;</span>Many women were there watching from afar, who had followed Jesus from Galilee, serving him.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.27.56"><span class="verse-num">56&nbsp;</span>Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.27.57"><span class="verse-num">57&nbsp;</span>When evening had come, a rich man from Arimathaea, named Joseph, who himself was also Jesus&rsquo; disciple came.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.27.58"><span class="verse-num">58&nbsp;</span>This man went to Pilate, and asked for Jesus&rsquo; body. Then Pilate commanded the body to be given up.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.27.59"><span class="verse-num">59&nbsp;</span>Joseph took the body, and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.27.60"><span class="verse-num">60&nbsp;</span>and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had cut out in the rock, and he rolled a great stone to the door of the tomb, and departed.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.27.61"><span class="verse-num">61&nbsp;</span>Mary Magdalene was there, and the other Mary, sitting opposite the tomb.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.27.62"><span class="verse-num">62&nbsp;</span>Now on the next day, which was the day after the Preparation Day, the chief priests and the Pharisees were gathered together to Pilate,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.27.63"><span class="verse-num">63&nbsp;</span>saying, &ldquo;Sir, we remember what that deceiver said while he was still alive: &lsquo;After three days I will rise again.&rsquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.27.64"><span class="verse-num">64&nbsp;</span>Command therefore that the tomb be made secure until the third day, lest perhaps his disciples come at night and steal him away, and tell the people, &lsquo;He is risen from the dead;&rsquo; and the last deception will be worse than the first.&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.27.65"><span class="verse-num">65&nbsp;</span>Pilate said to them, &ldquo;You have a guard. Go, make it as secure as you can.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.27.66"><span class="verse-num">66&nbsp;</span>So they went with the guard and made the tomb secure, sealing the stone.</span>

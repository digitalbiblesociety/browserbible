<span class="verse Mic_2_1" data-osis="Mic.2.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>Woe to those who devise iniquity<br /> and work evil on their beds!<br /> When the morning is light, they practice it,<br /> because it is in the power of their hand.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Mic_2_2" data-osis="Mic.2.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>They covet fields, and seize them;<br /> and houses, and take them away:<br /> and they oppress a man and his house,<br /> even a man and his heritage.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Mic_2_3" data-osis="Mic.2.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>Therefore thus says Yahweh:<br /> &ldquo;Behold, I am planning against these people a disaster,<br /> from which you will not remove your necks,<br /> neither will you walk haughtily;<br /> for it is an evil time.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Mic_2_4" data-osis="Mic.2.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>In that day they will take up a parable against you,<br /> and lament with a doleful lamentation, saying,<br /> &lsquo;We are utterly ruined!<br /> My people&rsquo;s possession is divided up.<br /> Indeed he takes it from me and assigns our fields to traitors!&rsquo;&rdquo;<br /></span>
<span class="verse Mic_2_5" data-osis="Mic.2.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>Therefore you will have no one who divides the land by lot in Yahweh&rsquo;s assembly.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Mic_2_6" data-osis="Mic.2.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t prophesy!&rdquo;<br /> They prophesy.<br /> &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t prophesy about these things.<br /> Disgrace won&rsquo;t overtake us.&rdquo;<br /></span>
<span class="verse Mic_2_7" data-osis="Mic.2.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>Shall it be said, O house of Jacob:<br /> &ldquo;Is the Spirit of Yahweh angry?<br /> Are these his doings?<br /> Don&rsquo;t my words do good to him who walks blamelessly?&rdquo;<br /></span>
<span class="verse Mic_2_8" data-osis="Mic.2.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>But lately my people have risen up as an enemy.<br /> You strip the robe and clothing from those who pass by without a care, returning from battle.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Mic_2_9" data-osis="Mic.2.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>You drive the women of my people out from their pleasant houses;<br /> from their young children you take away my blessing forever.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Mic_2_10" data-osis="Mic.2.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>Arise, and depart!<br /> For this is not your resting place,<br /> because of uncleanness that destroys,<br /> even with a grievous destruction.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Mic_2_11" data-osis="Mic.2.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>If a man walking in a spirit of falsehood lies:<br /> &ldquo;I will prophesy to you of wine and of strong drink&rdquo;;<br /> he would be the prophet of this people.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Mic_2_12" data-osis="Mic.2.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>I will surely assemble, Jacob, all of you;<br /> I will surely gather the remnant of Israel;<br /> I will put them together as the sheep of Bozrah,<br /> as a flock in the midst of their pasture;<br /> they will swarm with people.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Mic_2_13" data-osis="Mic.2.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>He who breaks open the way goes up before them.<br /> They break through the gate, and go out.<br /> And their king passes on before them,<br /> with Yahweh at their head.</span>

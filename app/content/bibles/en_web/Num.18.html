<span class="verse Num_18_2" data-osis="Num.18.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>Bring your brothers also, the tribe of Levi, the tribe of your father, near with you, that they may be joined to you, and minister to you; but you and your sons with you shall be before the tent of the testimony.</span>
<span class="verse Num_18_3" data-osis="Num.18.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>They shall keep your commands, and the duty of all the Tent; only they shall not come near to the vessels of the sanctuary and to the altar, that they not die, neither they, nor you.</span>
<span class="verse Num_18_4" data-osis="Num.18.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>They shall be joined to you, and keep the responsibility of the Tent of Meeting, for all the service of the Tent. A stranger shall not come near to you.</span>

<span class="verse Num_18_7" data-osis="Num.18.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>You and your sons with you shall keep your priesthood for everything of the altar, and for that within the veil.

<span class="verse Num_18_9" data-osis="Num.18.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>This shall be yours of the most holy things from the fire: every offering of theirs, even every meal offering of theirs, and every sin offering of theirs, and every trespass offering of theirs, which they shall render to me, shall be most holy for you and for your sons.</span>
<span class="verse Num_18_10" data-osis="Num.18.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>You shall eat of it like the most holy things. Every male shall eat of it. It shall be holy to you.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Num_18_12" data-osis="Num.18.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;I have given to you all the best of the oil, and all the best of the vintage, and of the grain, the first fruits of them which they give to Yahweh.</span>

<span class="verse Num_18_18" data-osis="Num.18.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>Their flesh shall be yours, as the wave offering breast and as the right thigh, it shall be yours.</span>

<span class="verse Num_18_23" data-osis="Num.18.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>But the Levites shall do the service of the Tent of Meeting, and they shall bear their iniquity.

<span class="verse Num_18_24" data-osis="Num.18.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span>For the tithe of the children of Israel, which they offer as a wave offering to Yahweh, I have given to the Levites for an inheritance.

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Num_18_25" data-osis="Num.18.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span>Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,</span>
<span class="verse Num_18_26" data-osis="Num.18.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Moreover you shall speak to the Levites, and tell them, &lsquo;When you take of the children of Israel the tithe which I have given you from them for your inheritance, then you shall offer up a wave offering of it for Yahweh, a tithe of the tithe.</span>
<span class="verse Num_18_27" data-osis="Num.18.27"><span class="verse-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span>Your wave offering shall be reckoned to you, as though it were the grain of the threshing floor, and as the fullness of the wine press.</span>
<span class="verse Num_18_28" data-osis="Num.18.28"><span class="verse-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span>Thus you also shall offer a wave offering to Yahweh of all your tithes, which you receive of the children of Israel; and of it you shall give Yahweh&rsquo;s wave offering to Aaron the priest.</span>
<span class="verse Num_18_29" data-osis="Num.18.29"><span class="verse-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span>Out of all your gifts, you shall offer every wave offering of Yahweh, of all its best, even the holy part of it out of it.&rsquo;</span>

<span class="verse Num_18_30" data-osis="Num.18.30"><span class="verse-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Therefore you shall tell them, &lsquo;When you heave its best from it, then it shall be reckoned to the Levites as the increase of the threshing floor, and as the increase of the wine press.</span>
<span class="verse Num_18_31" data-osis="Num.18.31"><span class="verse-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span>You may eat it anywhere, you and your households, for it is your reward in return for your service in the Tent of Meeting.</span>
<span class="verse Num_18_32" data-osis="Num.18.32"><span class="verse-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span>You shall bear no sin by reason of it, when you have heaved from it its best. You shall not profane the holy things of the children of Israel, that you not die.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span>

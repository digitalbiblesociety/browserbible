</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Num_21_6" data-osis="Num.21.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>Yahweh sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people. Many people of Israel died.</span>

<span class="verse Num_21_12" data-osis="Num.21.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>From there they traveled, and encamped in the valley of Zered.</span>

<span class="verse Num_21_17" data-osis="Num.21.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>Then Israel sang this song:<br /> &ldquo;Spring up, well! Sing to it,<br /></span>
<span class="verse Num_21_18" data-osis="Num.21.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>the well, which the princes dug,<br /> which the nobles of the people dug,<br /> with the scepter, and with their poles.&rdquo;<br>From the wilderness they traveled to Mattanah;</span>
<span class="verse Num_21_19" data-osis="Num.21.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>and from Mattanah to Nahaliel; and from Nahaliel to Bamoth;</span>
<span class="verse Num_21_20" data-osis="Num.21.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>and from Bamoth to the valley that is in the field of Moab, to the top of Pisgah, which looks down on the desert.</span>
<span class="verse Num_21_21" data-osis="Num.21.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, saying,</span>
<span class="verse Num_21_22" data-osis="Num.21.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Let me pass through your land. We will not turn aside into field, or into vineyard.

<p>
<span class="verse Num_21_23" data-osis="Num.21.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>Sihon would not allow Israel to pass through his border, but Sihon gathered all his people together, and went out against Israel into the wilderness, and came to Jahaz. He fought against Israel.</span>
<span class="verse Num_21_24" data-osis="Num.21.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span>Israel struck him with the edge of the sword, and possessed his land from the Arnon to the Jabbok, even to the children of Ammon; for the border of the children of Ammon was strong.</span>
<span class="verse Num_21_25" data-osis="Num.21.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span>Israel took all these cities. Israel lived in all the cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all its towns.</span>
<span class="verse Num_21_26" data-osis="Num.21.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span>For Heshbon was the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab, and taken all his land out of his hand, even to the Arnon.</span>
<span class="verse Num_21_27" data-osis="Num.21.27"><span class="verse-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span>Therefore those who speak in proverbs say,<br /> &ldquo;Come to Heshbon.<br /> Let the city of Sihon be built and established;<br /></span>
<span class="verse Num_21_28" data-osis="Num.21.28"><span class="verse-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span>for a fire has gone out of Heshbon,<br /> a flame from the city of Sihon.<br /> It has devoured Ar of Moab,<br /> The lords of the high places of the Arnon.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Num_21_29" data-osis="Num.21.29"><span class="verse-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span>Woe to you, Moab!<br /> You are undone, people of Chemosh!<br /> He has given his sons as fugitives,<br /> and his daughters into captivity,<br /> to Sihon king of the Amorites.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Num_21_30" data-osis="Num.21.30"><span class="verse-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span>We have shot at them.<br /> Heshbon has perished even to Dibon.<br /> We have laid waste even to Nophah,<br /> Which reaches to Medeba.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Num_21_31" data-osis="Num.21.31"><span class="verse-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span>Thus Israel lived in the land of the Amorites.</span>
<span class="verse Num_21_32" data-osis="Num.21.32"><span class="verse-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span>Moses sent to spy out Jazer. They took its towns, and drove out the Amorites who were there.</span>
<span class="verse Num_21_33" data-osis="Num.21.33"><span class="verse-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span>They turned and went up by the way of Bashan. Og the king of Bashan went out against them, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Num_21_34" data-osis="Num.21.34"><span class="verse-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span>Yahweh said to Moses, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t fear him, for I have delivered him into your hand, with all his people, and his land. You shall do to him as you did to Sihon king of the Amorites, who lived at Heshbon.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Num_21_35" data-osis="Num.21.35"><span class="verse-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span>So they struck him, with his sons and all his people, until there were no survivors; and they possessed his land.</span>

<span class="verse Num_27_3" data-osis="Num.27.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Our father died in the wilderness. He was not among the company of those who gathered themselves together against Yahweh in the company of Korah, but he died in his own sin. He had no sons.</span>
<span class="verse Num_27_4" data-osis="Num.27.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>Why should the name of our father be taken away from among his family, because he had no son? Give to us a possession among the brothers of our father.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse Num_27_7" data-osis="Num.27.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;The daughters of Zelophehad speak right. You shall surely give them a possession of an inheritance among their father&rsquo;s brothers. You shall cause the inheritance of their father to pass to them.</span>
<span class="verse Num_27_8" data-osis="Num.27.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>You shall speak to the children of Israel, saying, &lsquo;If a man dies, and has no son, then you shall cause his inheritance to pass to his daughter.</span>

<p>
<span class="verse Num_27_12" data-osis="Num.27.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>Yahweh said to Moses, &ldquo;Go up into this mountain of Abarim, and see the land which I have given to the children of Israel.</span>
<span class="verse Num_27_13" data-osis="Num.27.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>When you have seen it, you also shall be gathered to your people, as Aaron your brother was gathered;</span>
<span class="verse Num_27_14" data-osis="Num.27.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>because in the strife of the congregation, you rebelled against my word in the wilderness of Zin, to honor me as holy at the waters before their eyes.&rdquo; (These are the waters of Meribah of Kadesh in the wilderness of Zin.)</span>

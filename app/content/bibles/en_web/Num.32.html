<span class="verse Num_32_1" data-osis="Num.32.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>Now the children of Reuben and the children of Gad had a very great multitude of livestock. When they saw the land of Jazer, and the land of Gilead, that behold, the place was a place for livestock;</span>
<span class="verse Num_32_2" data-osis="Num.32.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>the children of Gad and the children of Reuben came and spoke to Moses, and to Eleazar the priest, and to the princes of the congregation, saying,</span>
<span class="verse Num_32_3" data-osis="Num.32.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Ataroth, Dibon, Jazer, Nimrah, Heshbon, Elealeh, Sebam, Nebo, and Beon,</span>
<span class="verse Num_32_4" data-osis="Num.32.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>the land which Yahweh struck before the congregation of Israel, is a land for livestock; and your servants have livestock.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Num_32_5" data-osis="Num.32.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>They said, &ldquo;If we have found favor in your sight, let this land be given to your servants for a possession. Don&rsquo;t bring us over the Jordan.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Num_32_6" data-osis="Num.32.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>Moses said to the children of Gad, and to the children of Reuben, &ldquo;Shall your brothers go to the war, and shall you sit here?</span>
<span class="verse Num_32_7" data-osis="Num.32.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>Why do you discourage the heart of the children of Israel from going over into the land which Yahweh has given them?</span>
<span class="verse Num_32_8" data-osis="Num.32.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>Your fathers did so when I sent them from Kadesh Barnea to see the land.</span>
<span class="verse Num_32_9" data-osis="Num.32.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>For when they went up to the valley of Eshcol, and saw the land, they discouraged the heart of the children of Israel, that they should not go into the land which Yahweh had given them.</span>
<span class="verse Num_32_10" data-osis="Num.32.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>Yahweh&rsquo;s anger was kindled in that day, and he swore, saying,</span>
<span class="verse Num_32_11" data-osis="Num.32.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>&lsquo;Surely none of the men who came up out of Egypt, from twenty years old and upward, shall see the land which I swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; because they have not wholly followed me,</span>
<span class="verse Num_32_12" data-osis="Num.32.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>except Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite, and Joshua the son of Nun; because they have followed Yahweh completely.&rsquo;</span>
<span class="verse Num_32_13" data-osis="Num.32.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>Yahweh&rsquo;s anger was kindled against Israel, and he made them wander back and forth in the wilderness forty years, until all the generation, who had done evil in the sight of Yahweh, was consumed.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Num_32_14" data-osis="Num.32.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Behold, you have risen up in your fathers&rsquo; place, an increase of sinful men, to increase the fierce anger of Yahweh toward Israel.</span>
<span class="verse Num_32_15" data-osis="Num.32.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>For if you turn away from after him, he will yet again leave them in the wilderness; and you will destroy all of these people.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Num_32_16" data-osis="Num.32.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>They came near to him, and said, &ldquo;We will build sheepfolds here for our livestock, and cities for our little ones;</span>
<span class="verse Num_32_17" data-osis="Num.32.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>but we ourselves will be ready armed to go before the children of Israel, until we have brought them to their place. Our little ones shall dwell in the fortified cities because of the inhabitants of the land.</span>
<span class="verse Num_32_18" data-osis="Num.32.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>We will not return to our houses, until the children of Israel have each inherited their inheritance.</span>
<span class="verse Num_32_19" data-osis="Num.32.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>For we will not inherit with them on the other side of the Jordan, and forward; because our inheritance has come to us on this side of the Jordan eastward.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Num_32_20" data-osis="Num.32.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>Moses said to them, &ldquo;If you will do this thing, if you will arm yourselves to go before Yahweh to the war,</span>
<span class="verse Num_32_21" data-osis="Num.32.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>and every armed man of you will pass over the Jordan before Yahweh, until he has driven out his enemies from before him,</span>
<span class="verse Num_32_22" data-osis="Num.32.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>and the land is subdued before Yahweh; then afterward you shall return, and be guiltless towards Yahweh, and towards Israel; and this land shall be to you for a possession before Yahweh.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Num_32_23" data-osis="Num.32.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;But if you will not do so, behold, you have sinned against Yahweh; and be sure your sin will find you out.</span>
<span class="verse Num_32_24" data-osis="Num.32.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span>Build cities for your little ones, and folds for your sheep; and do that which has proceeded out of your mouth.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Num_32_25" data-osis="Num.32.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span>The children of Gad and the children of Reuben spoke to Moses, saying, &ldquo;Your servants will do as my lord commands.</span>
<span class="verse Num_32_26" data-osis="Num.32.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span>Our little ones, our wives, our flocks, and all our livestock, shall be there in the cities of Gilead;</span>
<span class="verse Num_32_27" data-osis="Num.32.27"><span class="verse-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span>but your servants will pass over, every man who is armed for war, before Yahweh to battle, as my lord says.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Num_32_28" data-osis="Num.32.28"><span class="verse-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span>So Moses commanded concerning them to Eleazar the priest, and to Joshua the son of Nun, and to the heads of the fathers&rsquo; households of the tribes of the children of Israel.</span>
<span class="verse Num_32_29" data-osis="Num.32.29"><span class="verse-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span>Moses said to them, &ldquo;If the children of Gad and the children of Reuben will pass with you over the Jordan, every man who is armed to battle, before Yahweh, and the land is subdued before you, then you shall give them the land of Gilead for a possession;</span>
<span class="verse Num_32_30" data-osis="Num.32.30"><span class="verse-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span>but if they will not pass over with you armed, they shall have possessions among you in the land of Canaan.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Num_32_31" data-osis="Num.32.31"><span class="verse-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span>The children of Gad and the children of Reuben answered, saying, &ldquo;As Yahweh has said to your servants, so will we do.</span>
<span class="verse Num_32_32" data-osis="Num.32.32"><span class="verse-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span>We will pass over armed before Yahweh into the land of Canaan, and the possession of our inheritance shall remain with us beyond the Jordan.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Num_32_33" data-osis="Num.32.33"><span class="verse-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span>Moses gave to them, even to the children of Gad, and to the children of Reuben, and to the half-tribe of Manasseh the son of Joseph, the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, and the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, the land, according to its cities and borders, even the cities of the surrounding land.</span>
<span class="verse Num_32_34" data-osis="Num.32.34"><span class="verse-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span>The children of Gad built Dibon, Ataroth, Aroer,</span>
<span class="verse Num_32_35" data-osis="Num.32.35"><span class="verse-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span>Atrothshophan, Jazer, Jogbehah,</span>
<span class="verse Num_32_36" data-osis="Num.32.36"><span class="verse-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span>Beth Nimrah, and Beth Haran: fortified cities, and folds for sheep.</span>
<span class="verse Num_32_37" data-osis="Num.32.37"><span class="verse-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span>The children of Reuben built Heshbon, Elealeh, Kiriathaim,</span>

<span class="verse Num_35_17" data-osis="Num.35.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>If he struck him with a stone in the hand, by which a man may die, and he died, he is a murderer. The murderer shall surely be put to death.</span>

<p>
<span class="verse Num_35_26" data-osis="Num.35.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;&lsquo;But if the man slayer shall at any time go beyond the border of his city of refuge, where he flees,</span>
<span class="verse Num_35_27" data-osis="Num.35.27"><span class="verse-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span>and the avenger of blood finds him outside of the border of his city of refuge, and the avenger of blood kills the man slayer; he shall not be guilty of blood,</span>
<span class="verse Num_35_28" data-osis="Num.35.28"><span class="verse-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span>because he should have remained in his city of refuge until the death of the high priest. But after the death of the high priest, the man slayer shall return into the land of his possession.</span>

<p>
<span class="verse Num_35_29" data-osis="Num.35.29"><span class="verse-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;&lsquo;These things shall be for a statute and ordinance to you throughout your generations in all your dwellings.</span>

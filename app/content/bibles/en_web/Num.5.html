<span class="verse Num_5_8" data-osis="Num.5.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>But if the man has no kinsman to whom restitution may be made for the guilt, the restitution for guilt which is made to Yahweh shall be the priest&rsquo;s; besides the ram of the atonement, by which atonement shall be made for him.</span>

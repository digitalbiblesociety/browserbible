<span class="verse Obad_1_3" data-osis="Obad.1.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>The pride of your heart has deceived you, you who dwell in the clefts of the rock, whose habitation is high, who says in his heart, &lsquo;Who will bring me down to the ground?&rsquo;</span>
<span class="verse Obad_1_4" data-osis="Obad.1.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>Though you mount on high as the eagle, and though your nest is set among the stars, I will bring you down from there,&rdquo; says Yahweh.</span>
<span class="verse Obad_1_5" data-osis="Obad.1.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;If thieves came to you, if robbers by night&mdash;oh, what disaster awaits you&mdash;wouldn&rsquo;t they only steal until they had enough? If grape pickers came to you, wouldn&rsquo;t they leave some gleaning grapes?</span>
<span class="verse Obad_1_6" data-osis="Obad.1.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>How Esau will be ransacked! How his hidden treasures are sought out!</span>
<span class="verse Obad_1_7" data-osis="Obad.1.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>All the men of your alliance have brought you on your way, even to the border. The men who were at peace with you have deceived you, and prevailed against you. Friends who eat your bread lay a snare under you. There is no understanding in him.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse Obad_1_11" data-osis="Obad.1.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>In the day that you stood on the other side, in the day that strangers carried away his substance, and foreigners entered into his gates, and cast lots for Jerusalem, even you were like one of them.</span>
<span class="verse Obad_1_12" data-osis="Obad.1.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>But don&rsquo;t look down on your brother in the day of his disaster, and don&rsquo;t rejoice over the children of Judah in the day of their destruction. Don&rsquo;t speak proudly in the day of distress.</span>
<span class="verse Obad_1_13" data-osis="Obad.1.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>Don&rsquo;t enter into the gate of my people in the day of their calamity.

<span class="verse Obad_1_16" data-osis="Obad.1.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>For as you have drunk on my holy mountain, so will all the nations drink continually. Yes, they will drink, swallow down, and will be as though they had not been.</span>
<span class="verse Obad_1_17" data-osis="Obad.1.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>But in Mount Zion, there will be those who escape, and it will be holy. The house of Jacob will possess their possessions.</span>
<span class="verse Obad_1_18" data-osis="Obad.1.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>The house of Jacob will be a fire, the house of Joseph a flame, and the house of Esau for stubble.

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Phil_2_1" data-osis="Phil.2.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>If there is therefore any exhortation in Christ, if any consolation of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any tender mercies and compassion,</span>
<span class="verse Phil_2_2" data-osis="Phil.2.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>make my joy full, by being like-minded, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind;</span>
<span class="verse Phil_2_3" data-osis="Phil.2.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>doing nothing through rivalry or through conceit, but in humility, each counting others better than himself;</span>
<span class="verse Phil_2_4" data-osis="Phil.2.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>each of you not just looking to his own things, but each of you also to the things of others.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Phil_2_5" data-osis="Phil.2.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>Have this in your mind, which was also in Christ Jesus,</span>
<span class="verse Phil_2_6" data-osis="Phil.2.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>who, existing in the form of God, didn&rsquo;t consider equality with God a thing to be grasped,</span>
<span class="verse Phil_2_7" data-osis="Phil.2.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>but emptied himself, taking the form of a servant, being made in the likeness of men.</span>
<span class="verse Phil_2_8" data-osis="Phil.2.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>And being found in human form, he humbled himself, becoming obedient to death, yes, the death of the cross.</span>
<span class="verse Phil_2_9" data-osis="Phil.2.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>Therefore God also highly exalted him, and gave to him the name which is above every name;</span>
<span class="verse Phil_2_10" data-osis="Phil.2.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of those in heaven, those on earth, and those under the earth,</span>
<span class="verse Phil_2_11" data-osis="Phil.2.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Phil_2_12" data-osis="Phil.2.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>So then, my beloved, even as you have always obeyed, not only in my presence, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.</span>
<span class="verse Phil_2_13" data-osis="Phil.2.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>For it is God who works in you both to will and to work, for his good pleasure.</span>
<span class="verse Phil_2_14" data-osis="Phil.2.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>Do all things without murmurings and disputes,</span>
<span class="verse Phil_2_15" data-osis="Phil.2.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>that you may become blameless and harmless, children of God without defect in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, among whom you are seen as lights in the world,</span>
<span class="verse Phil_2_16" data-osis="Phil.2.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>holding up the word of life; that I may have something to boast in the day of Christ, that I didn&rsquo;t run in vain nor labor in vain.</span>
<span class="verse Phil_2_17" data-osis="Phil.2.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>Yes, and if I am poured out on the sacrifice and service of your faith, I rejoice, and rejoice with you all.</span>
<span class="verse Phil_2_18" data-osis="Phil.2.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>In the same way, you also rejoice, and rejoice with me.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Phil_2_19" data-osis="Phil.2.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>But I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon, that I also may be cheered up when I know how you are doing.</span>
<span class="verse Phil_2_20" data-osis="Phil.2.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>For I have no one else like-minded, who will truly care about you.</span>
<span class="verse Phil_2_21" data-osis="Phil.2.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>For they all seek their own, not the things of Jesus Christ.</span>
<span class="verse Phil_2_22" data-osis="Phil.2.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>But you know the proof of him, that, as a child serves a father, so he served with me in furtherance of the Good News.</span>
<span class="verse Phil_2_23" data-osis="Phil.2.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>Therefore I hope to send him at once, as soon as I see how it will go with me.</span>
<span class="verse Phil_2_24" data-osis="Phil.2.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span>But I trust in the Lord that I myself also will come shortly.</span>
<span class="verse Phil_2_25" data-osis="Phil.2.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span>But I counted it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother, fellow worker, fellow soldier, and your apostle and servant of my need;</span>
<span class="verse Phil_2_26" data-osis="Phil.2.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span>since he longed for you all, and was very troubled, because you had heard that he was sick.</span>
<span class="verse Phil_2_27" data-osis="Phil.2.27"><span class="verse-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span>For indeed he was sick, nearly to death, but God had mercy on him; and not on him only, but on me also, that I might not have sorrow on sorrow.</span>
<span class="verse Phil_2_28" data-osis="Phil.2.28"><span class="verse-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span>I have sent him therefore the more diligently, that, when you see him again, you may rejoice, and that I may be the less sorrowful.</span>
<span class="verse Phil_2_29" data-osis="Phil.2.29"><span class="verse-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span>Receive him therefore in the Lord with all joy, and hold such in honor,</span>
<span class="verse Phil_2_30" data-osis="Phil.2.30"><span class="verse-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span>because for the work of Christ he came near to death, risking his life to supply that which was lacking in your service toward me.</span>

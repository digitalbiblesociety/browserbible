<span class="verse Rev_4_1" data-osis="Rev.4.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>After these things I looked and saw a door opened in heaven, and the first voice that I heard, like a trumpet speaking with me, was one saying, &ldquo;Come up here, and I will show you the things which must happen after this.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Rev_4_2" data-osis="Rev.4.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>Immediately I was in the Spirit. Behold, there was a throne set in heaven, and one sitting on the throne</span>
<span class="verse Rev_4_3" data-osis="Rev.4.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>that looked like a jasper stone and a sardius. There was a rainbow around the throne, like an emerald to look at.</span>
<span class="verse Rev_4_4" data-osis="Rev.4.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>Around the throne were twenty-four thrones. On the thrones were twenty-four elders sitting, dressed in white garments, with crowns of gold on their heads.</span>
<span class="verse Rev_4_5" data-osis="Rev.4.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>Out of the throne proceed lightnings, sounds, and thunders. There were seven lamps of fire burning before his throne, which are the seven Spirits of God.</span>
<span class="verse Rev_4_6" data-osis="Rev.4.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>Before the throne was something like a sea of glass, similar to crystal. In the midst of the throne, and around the throne were four living creatures full of eyes before and behind.</span>
<span class="verse Rev_4_7" data-osis="Rev.4.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>The first creature was like a lion, and the second creature like a calf, and the third creature had a face like a man, and the fourth was like a flying eagle.</span>
<span class="verse Rev_4_8" data-osis="Rev.4.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>The four living creatures, each one of them having six wings, are full of eyes around and within. They have no rest day and night, saying, &ldquo;Holy, holy, holy<span class="note">+<dfn>Hodges/Farstad MT reads &ldquo;holy&rdquo; 9 times instead of 3.</dfn></span> is the Lord God, the Almighty, who was and who is and who is to come!&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse Rev_4_9" data-osis="Rev.4.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>When the living creatures give glory, honor, and thanks to him who sits on the throne, to him who lives forever and ever,</span>
<span class="verse Rev_4_10" data-osis="Rev.4.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>the twenty-four elders fall down before him who sits on the throne, and worship him who lives forever and ever, and throw their crowns before the throne, saying,</span>
<span class="verse Rev_4_11" data-osis="Rev.4.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Worthy are you, our Lord and God, the Holy One,<span class="note">+<dfn>TR omits &ldquo;and God, the Holy One,&rdquo;</dfn></span> to receive the glory, the honor, and the power, for you created all things, and because of your desire they existed, and were created!&rdquo;</span>

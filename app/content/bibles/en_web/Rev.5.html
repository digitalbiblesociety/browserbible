<span class="verse Rev_5_2" data-osis="Rev.5.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>I saw a mighty angel proclaiming with a loud voice, &ldquo;Who is worthy to open the book, and to break its seals?&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse Rev_5_4" data-osis="Rev.5.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>And I wept much, because no one was found worthy to open the book, or to look in it.</span>
<span class="verse Rev_5_5" data-osis="Rev.5.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>One of the elders said to me, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t weep. Behold, the Lion who is of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has overcome; he who opens the book and its seven seals.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Rev_5_6" data-osis="Rev.5.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>I saw in the midst of the throne and of the four living creatures, and in the midst of the elders, a Lamb standing, as though it had been slain, having seven horns, and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God, sent out into all the earth.</span>
<span class="verse Rev_5_7" data-osis="Rev.5.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>Then he came, and he took it out of the right hand of him who sat on the throne.</span>
<span class="verse Rev_5_8" data-osis="Rev.5.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>Now when he had taken the book, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb, each one having a harp, and golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of the saints.</span>
<span class="verse Rev_5_9" data-osis="Rev.5.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>They sang a new song, saying,<br /> &ldquo;You are worthy to take the book,<br /> and to open its seals:<br /> for you were killed,<br /> and bought us for God with your blood,<br /> out of every tribe, language, people, and nation,<br /></span>
<span class="verse Rev_5_10" data-osis="Rev.5.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>and made us kings and priests to our God,<br /> and we will reign on earth.&rdquo;</span>

<p>
<span class="verse Rev_6_9" data-osis="Rev.6.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>When he opened the fifth seal, I saw underneath the altar the souls of those who had been killed for the Word of God, and for the testimony of the Lamb which they had.</span>
<span class="verse Rev_6_10" data-osis="Rev.6.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>They cried with a loud voice, saying, &ldquo;How long, Master, the holy and true, until you judge and avenge our blood on those who dwell on the earth?&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse Rev_6_12" data-osis="Rev.6.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>I saw when he opened the sixth seal, and there was a great earthquake. The sun became black as sackcloth made of hair, and the whole moon became as blood.</span>
<span class="verse Rev_6_13" data-osis="Rev.6.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>The stars of the sky fell to the earth, like a fig tree dropping its unripe figs when it is shaken by a great wind.</span>
<span class="verse Rev_6_14" data-osis="Rev.6.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>The sky was removed like a scroll when it is rolled up. Every mountain and island were moved out of their places.</span>

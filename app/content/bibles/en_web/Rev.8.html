<span class="verse Rev_8_2" data-osis="Rev.8.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>I saw the seven angels who stand before God, and seven trumpets were given to them.</span>
<span class="verse Rev_8_3" data-osis="Rev.8.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>Another angel came and stood over the altar, having a golden censer. Much incense was given to him, that he should add it to the prayers of all the saints on the golden altar which was before the throne.</span>
<span class="verse Rev_8_4" data-osis="Rev.8.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>The smoke of the incense, with the prayers of the saints, went up before God out of the angel&rsquo;s hand.</span>
<span class="verse Rev_8_5" data-osis="Rev.8.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>The angel took the censer, and he filled it with the fire of the altar, and threw it on the earth. There followed thunders, sounds, lightnings, and an earthquake.</span>

<span class="verse Rev_8_6" data-osis="Rev.8.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>The seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound.</span>
<span class="verse Rev_8_7" data-osis="Rev.8.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>The first sounded, and there followed hail and fire, mixed with blood, and they were thrown to the earth. One third of the earth was burnt up,<span class="note"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">TR omits &ldquo;One third of the earth was burnt up&rdquo;</span></span>  and one third of the trees were burnt up, and all green grass was burnt up.</span>

<p>
<span class="verse Rev_8_8" data-osis="Rev.8.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>The second angel sounded, and something like a great burning mountain was thrown into the sea. One third of the sea became blood,</span>
<span class="verse Rev_8_9" data-osis="Rev.8.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>and one third of the living creatures which were in the sea died. One third of the ships were destroyed.</span>

<p>
<span class="verse Rev_8_10" data-osis="Rev.8.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>The third angel sounded, and a great star fell from the sky, burning like a torch, and it fell on one third of the rivers, and on the springs of the waters.</span>
<span class="verse Rev_8_11" data-osis="Rev.8.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>The name of the star is called &ldquo;Wormwood.&rdquo; One third of the waters became wormwood. Many people died from the waters, because they were made bitter.</span>

Woe! Woe for those who dwell on the earth, because of the other voices of the trumpets of the three angels, who are yet to sound!&rdquo;</span>

<p>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Rev.9.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>The fifth angel sounded, and I saw a star from the sky which had fallen to the earth. The key to the pit of the abyss was given to him.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rev.9.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>He opened the pit of the abyss, and smoke went up out of the pit, like the smoke from a<span class="note">+<dfn>TR adds &ldquo;great&rdquo;</dfn></span> burning furnace. The sun and the air were darkened because of the smoke from the pit.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rev.9.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>Then out of the smoke came locusts on the earth, and power was given to them, as the scorpions of the earth have power.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rev.9.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>They were told that they should not hurt the grass of the earth, neither any green thing, neither any tree, but only those people who don&rsquo;t have God&rsquo;s seal on their foreheads.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rev.9.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>They were given power not to kill them, but to torment them for five months. Their torment was like the torment of a scorpion, when it strikes a person.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rev.9.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>In those days people will seek death, and will in no way find it. They will desire to die, and death will flee from them.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rev.9.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>The shapes of the locusts were like horses prepared for war. On their heads were something like golden crowns, and their faces were like people&rsquo;s faces.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rev.9.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>They had hair like women&rsquo;s hair, and their teeth were like those of lions.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rev.9.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>They had breastplates, like breastplates of iron. The sound of their wings was like the sound of chariots, or of many horses rushing to war.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rev.9.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>They have tails like those of scorpions, and stings. In their tails they have power to harm men for five months.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rev.9.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>They have over them as king the angel of the abyss. His name in Hebrew is &ldquo;Abaddon,&rdquo;<span class="note">+<dfn>&ldquo;Abaddon&rdquo; is a Hebrew word that means ruin, destruction, or the place of destruction</dfn></span> but in Greek, he has the name &ldquo;Apollyon.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rev.9.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>The first woe is past. Behold, there are still two woes coming after this.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Rev.9.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>The sixth angel sounded. I heard a voice from the horns of the golden altar which is before God,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rev.9.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>saying to the sixth angel who had one trumpet, &ldquo;Free the four angels who are bound at the great river Euphrates!&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Rev.9.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>The four angels were freed who had been prepared for that hour and day and month and year, so that they might kill one third of mankind.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rev.9.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span>The number of the armies of the horsemen was two hundred million</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rev.9.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span>Thus I saw the horses in the vision, and those who sat on them, having breastplates of fiery red, hyacinth blue, and sulfur yellow; and the heads of lions. Out of their mouths proceed fire, smoke, and sulfur.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rev.9.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span>By these three plagues were one third of mankind killed: by the fire, the smoke, and the sulfur, which proceeded out of their mouths.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rev.9.19"><span class="verse-num">19&nbsp;</span>For the power of the horses is in their mouths, and in their tails. For their tails are like serpents, and have heads, and with them they harm.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rev.9.20"><span class="verse-num">20&nbsp;</span>The rest of mankind, who were not killed with these plagues, didn&rsquo;t repent of the works of their hands, that they wouldn&rsquo;t worship demons, and the idols of gold, and of silver, and of brass, and of stone, and of wood; which can neither see, nor hear, nor walk.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rev.9.21"><span class="verse-num">21&nbsp;</span>They didn&rsquo;t repent of their murders, nor of their sorceries,<span class="note">+<dfn>The word for &ldquo;sorceries&rdquo; (pharmakeia) also implies the use of potions, poisons, and drugs</dfn></span> nor of their sexual immorality, nor of their thefts.</span>

<span class="verse Rom_11_1" data-osis="Rom.11.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>I ask then, did God reject his people? May it never be! For I also am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_11_2" data-osis="Rom.11.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>God didn&rsquo;t reject his people, which he foreknew. Or don&rsquo;t you know what the Scripture says about Elijah? How he pleads with God against Israel:</span>
<span class="verse Rom_11_3" data-osis="Rom.11.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Lord, they have killed your prophets, they have broken down your altars; and I am left alone, and they seek my life.&rdquo;<span class="cf">+<dfn>1 Kings 19:10,14</dfn></span></span>
<span class="verse Rom_11_4" data-osis="Rom.11.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>But how does God answer him? &ldquo;I have reserved for myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to Baal.&rdquo;<span class="cf">+<dfn>1 Kings 19:18</dfn></span></span>
<span class="verse Rom_11_5" data-osis="Rom.11.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_11_6" data-osis="Rom.11.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>And if by grace, then it is no longer of works; otherwise grace is no longer grace. But if it is of works, it is no longer grace; otherwise work is no longer work.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Rom_11_7" data-osis="Rom.11.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>What then? That which Israel seeks for, that he didn&rsquo;t obtain, but the chosen ones obtained it, and the rest were hardened.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_11_8" data-osis="Rom.11.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>According as it is written, &ldquo;God gave them a spirit of stupor, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear, to this very day.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Rom_11_9" data-osis="Rom.11.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>David says,</span>
<span class="verse Rom_11_10" data-osis="Rom.11.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Rom_11_11" data-osis="Rom.11.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>I ask then, did they stumble that they might fall? May it never be! But by their fall salvation has come to the Gentiles, to provoke them to jealousy.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_11_12" data-osis="Rom.11.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>Now if their fall is the riches of the world, and their loss the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their fullness?</span>
<span class="verse Rom_11_13" data-osis="Rom.11.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>For I speak to you who are Gentiles. Since then as I am an apostle to Gentiles, I glorify my ministry;</span>
<span class="verse Rom_11_14" data-osis="Rom.11.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>if by any means I may provoke to jealousy those who are my flesh, and may save some of them.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_11_15" data-osis="Rom.11.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>For if the rejection of them is the reconciling of the world, what would their acceptance be, but life from the dead?</span>
<span class="verse Rom_11_16" data-osis="Rom.11.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>If the first fruit is holy, so is the lump. If the root is holy, so are the branches.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_11_17" data-osis="Rom.11.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>But if some of the branches were broken off, and you, being a wild olive, were grafted in among them, and became partaker with them of the root and of the richness of the olive tree;</span>
<span class="verse Rom_11_18" data-osis="Rom.11.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>don&rsquo;t boast over the branches. But if you boast, it is not you who support the root, but the root supports you.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_11_19" data-osis="Rom.11.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>You will say then, &ldquo;Branches were broken off, that I might be grafted in.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Rom_11_20" data-osis="Rom.11.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>True; by their unbelief they were broken off, and you stand by your faith. Don&rsquo;t be conceited, but fear;</span>
<span class="verse Rom_11_21" data-osis="Rom.11.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>for if God didn&rsquo;t spare the natural branches, neither will he spare you.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_11_22" data-osis="Rom.11.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>See then the goodness and severity of God. Toward those who fell, severity; but toward you, goodness, if you continue in his goodness; otherwise you also will be cut off.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_11_23" data-osis="Rom.11.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>They also, if they don&rsquo;t continue in their unbelief, will be grafted in, for God is able to graft them in again.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_11_24" data-osis="Rom.11.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span>For if you were cut out of that which is by nature a wild olive tree, and were grafted contrary to nature into a good olive tree, how much more will these, which are the natural branches, be grafted into their own olive tree?</span>
<span class="verse Rom_11_25" data-osis="Rom.11.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span>For I don&rsquo;t desire you to be ignorant, brothers,<span class="note">+<dfn>The word for &ldquo;brothers&rdquo; here and where context allows may also be correctly translated &ldquo;brothers and sisters&rdquo; or &ldquo;siblings.&rdquo;</dfn></span> of this mystery, so that you won&rsquo;t be wise in your own conceits, that a partial hardening has happened to Israel, until the fullness of the Gentiles has come in,</span>
<span class="verse Rom_11_26" data-osis="Rom.11.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span>and so all Israel will be saved. Even as it is written,</span>
<span class="verse Rom_11_27" data-osis="Rom.11.27"><span class="verse-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span>This is my covenant to them,</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Rom_11_28" data-osis="Rom.11.28"><span class="verse-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span>Concerning the Good News, they are enemies for your sake. But concerning the election, they are beloved for the fathers&rsquo; sake.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_11_29" data-osis="Rom.11.29"><span class="verse-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span>For the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_11_30" data-osis="Rom.11.30"><span class="verse-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span>For as you in time past were disobedient to God, but now have obtained mercy by their disobedience,</span>
<span class="verse Rom_11_31" data-osis="Rom.11.31"><span class="verse-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span>even so these also have now been disobedient, that by the mercy shown to you they may also obtain mercy.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_11_32" data-osis="Rom.11.32"><span class="verse-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span>For God has shut up all to disobedience, that he might have mercy on all.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Rom_11_33" data-osis="Rom.11.33"><span class="verse-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span>Oh the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and the knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past tracing out!</span>
<span class="verse Rom_11_34" data-osis="Rom.11.34"><span class="verse-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;For who has known the mind of the Lord?</span>
<span class="verse Rom_11_35" data-osis="Rom.11.35"><span class="verse-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Or who has first given to him,</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Rom_11_36" data-osis="Rom.11.36"><span class="verse-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span>For of him, and through him, and to him, are all things. To him be the glory for ever! Amen.</span>

<p>
<span class="verse Rom_14_1" data-osis="Rom.14.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>Now accept one who is weak in faith, but not for disputes over opinions.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_14_2" data-osis="Rom.14.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>One man has faith to eat all things, but he who is weak eats only vegetables.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_14_3" data-osis="Rom.14.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>Don&rsquo;t let him who eats despise him who doesn&rsquo;t eat. Don&rsquo;t let him who doesn&rsquo;t eat judge him who eats, for God has accepted him.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_14_4" data-osis="Rom.14.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>Who are you who judge another&rsquo;s servant? To his own lord he stands or falls. Yes, he will be made to stand, for God has power to make him stand.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Rom_14_5" data-osis="Rom.14.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>One man esteems one day as more important. Another esteems every day alike. Let each man be fully assured in his own mind.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_14_6" data-osis="Rom.14.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>He who observes the day, observes it to the Lord; and he who does not observe the day, to the Lord he does not observe it. He who eats, eats to the Lord, for he gives God thanks. He who doesn&rsquo;t eat, to the Lord he doesn&rsquo;t eat, and gives God thanks.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_14_7" data-osis="Rom.14.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>For none of us lives to himself, and none dies to himself.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_14_8" data-osis="Rom.14.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>For if we live, we live to the Lord. Or if we die, we die to the Lord. If therefore we live or die, we are the Lord&rsquo;s.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_14_9" data-osis="Rom.14.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>For to this end Christ died, rose, and lived again, that he might be Lord of both the dead and the living.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Rom_14_10" data-osis="Rom.14.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>But you, why do you judge your brother? Or you again, why do you despise your brother? For we will all stand before the judgment seat of Christ.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_14_11" data-osis="Rom.14.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>For it is written,</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Rom_14_12" data-osis="Rom.14.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>So then each one of us will give account of himself to God.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_14_13" data-osis="Rom.14.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>Therefore let&rsquo;s not judge one another any more, but judge this rather, that no man put a stumbling block in his brother&rsquo;s way, or an occasion for falling.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_14_14" data-osis="Rom.14.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>I know, and am persuaded in the Lord Jesus, that nothing is unclean of itself; except that to him who considers anything to be unclean, to him it is unclean.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_14_15" data-osis="Rom.14.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>Yet if because of food your brother is grieved, you walk no longer in love. Don&rsquo;t destroy with your food him for whom Christ died.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_14_16" data-osis="Rom.14.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>Then don&rsquo;t let your good be slandered,</span>
<span class="verse Rom_14_17" data-osis="Rom.14.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>for the Kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_14_18" data-osis="Rom.14.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>For he who serves Christ in these things is acceptable to God and approved by men.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_14_19" data-osis="Rom.14.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>So then, let us follow after things which make for peace, and things by which we may build one another up.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_14_20" data-osis="Rom.14.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>Don&rsquo;t overthrow God&rsquo;s work for food&rsquo;s sake. All things indeed are clean, however it is evil for that man who creates a stumbling block by eating.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_14_21" data-osis="Rom.14.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>It is good to not eat meat, drink wine, nor do anything by which your brother stumbles, is offended, or is made weak.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Rom_14_22" data-osis="Rom.14.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>Do you have faith? Have it to yourself before God. Happy is he who doesn&rsquo;t judge himself in that which he approves.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_14_23" data-osis="Rom.14.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>But he who doubts is condemned if he eats, because it isn&rsquo;t of faith; and whatever is not of faith is sin.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Rom_14_24" data-osis="Rom.14.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span>Now to him who is able to establish you according to my Good News and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery which has been kept secret through long ages,</span>
<span class="verse Rom_14_25" data-osis="Rom.14.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span>but now is revealed, and by the Scriptures of the prophets, according to the commandment of the eternal God, is made known for obedience of faith to all the nations;</span>
<span class="verse Rom_14_26" data-osis="Rom.14.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span>to the only wise God, through Jesus Christ, to whom be the glory forever! Amen.<span class="note">+<dfn>TR places verses 24-26 after Romans 16:24 as verses 25-27.</dfn></span></span>

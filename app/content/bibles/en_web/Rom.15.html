<span class="verse Rom_15_15" data-osis="Rom.15.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>But I write the more boldly to you in part, as reminding you, because of the grace that was given to me by God,</span>
<span class="verse Rom_15_16" data-osis="Rom.15.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>that I should be a servant of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles, serving as a priest the Good News of God, that the offering up of the Gentiles might be made acceptable, sanctified by the Holy Spirit.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_15_17" data-osis="Rom.15.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>I have therefore my boasting in Christ Jesus in things pertaining to God.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_15_18" data-osis="Rom.15.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>For I will not dare to speak of any things except those which Christ worked through me, for the obedience of the Gentiles, by word and deed,</span>
<span class="verse Rom_15_19" data-osis="Rom.15.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>in the power of signs and wonders, in the power of God&rsquo;s Spirit; so that from Jerusalem, and around as far as to Illyricum, I have fully preached the Good News of Christ;</span>
<span class="verse Rom_15_20" data-osis="Rom.15.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>yes, making it my aim to preach the Good News, not where Christ was already named, that I might not build on another&rsquo;s foundation.</span>

<span class="verse Rom_15_22" data-osis="Rom.15.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>Therefore also I was hindered these many times from coming to you,</span>
<span class="verse Rom_15_23" data-osis="Rom.15.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>but now, no longer having any place in these regions, and having these many years a longing to come to you,</span>
<span class="verse Rom_15_24" data-osis="Rom.15.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span>whenever I journey to Spain, I will come to you. For I hope to see you on my journey, and to be helped on my way there by you, if first I may enjoy your company for a while.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_15_25" data-osis="Rom.15.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span>But now, I say, I am going to Jerusalem, serving the saints.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_15_26" data-osis="Rom.15.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span>For it has been the good pleasure of Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor among the saints who are at Jerusalem.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_15_27" data-osis="Rom.15.27"><span class="verse-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span>Yes, it has been their good pleasure, and they are their debtors. For if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things, they owe it to them also to serve them in fleshly things.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_15_28" data-osis="Rom.15.28"><span class="verse-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span>When therefore I have accomplished this, and have sealed to them this fruit, I will go on by way of you to Spain.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_15_29" data-osis="Rom.15.29"><span class="verse-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span>I know that, when I come to you, I will come in the fullness of the blessing of the Good News of Christ.</span>

<p>
<span class="verse Rom_15_30" data-osis="Rom.15.30"><span class="verse-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span>Now I beg you, brothers, by our Lord Jesus Christ, and by the love of the Spirit, that you strive together with me in your prayers to God for me,</span>
<span class="verse Rom_15_31" data-osis="Rom.15.31"><span class="verse-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span>that I may be delivered from those who are disobedient in Judea, and that my service which I have for Jerusalem may be acceptable to the saints;</span>
<span class="verse Rom_15_32" data-osis="Rom.15.32"><span class="verse-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span>that I may come to you in joy through the will of God, and together with you, find rest.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_15_33" data-osis="Rom.15.33"><span class="verse-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span>Now the God of peace be with you all. Amen.</span>

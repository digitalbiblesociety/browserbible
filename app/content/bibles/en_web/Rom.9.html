<span class="verse" data-osis="Rom.9.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>I tell the truth in Christ. I am not lying, my conscience testifying with me in the Holy Spirit,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rom.9.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>that I have great sorrow and unceasing pain in my heart.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rom.9.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>For I could wish that I myself were accursed from Christ for my brothers&rsquo; sake, my relatives according to the flesh,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rom.9.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>who are Israelites; whose is the adoption, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the law, the service, and the promises;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rom.9.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>of whom are the fathers, and from whom is Christ as concerning the flesh, who is over all, God, blessed forever. Amen.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Rom.9.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>But it is not as though the word of God has come to nothing. For they are not all Israel, that are of Israel.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rom.9.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>Neither, because they are Abraham&rsquo;s seed, are they all children. But, &ldquo;In Isaac will your seed be called.&rdquo;\x + Genesis 21:12\x*</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rom.9.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>That is, it is not the children of the flesh who are children of God, but the children of the promise are counted as a seed.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rom.9.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>For this is a word of promise, &ldquo;At the appointed time I will come, and Sarah will have a son.&rdquo;\x + Genesis 18:10,14\x*</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rom.9.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>Not only so, but Rebekah also conceived by one, by our father Isaac.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rom.9.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>For being not yet born, neither having done anything good or bad, that the purpose of God according to election might stand, not of works, but of him who calls,<span class="note">+<dfn>NA puts the phrase &ldquo;not of works, but of him who calls&rdquo; at the beginning of verse 12 instead of the end of verse 11.</dfn></span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rom.9.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>it was said to her, &ldquo;The elder will serve the younger.&rdquo;\x + Genesis 25:23\x*</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rom.9.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>Even as it is written, &ldquo;Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated.&rdquo;\x + Malachi 1:2-3\x*</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Rom.9.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>What shall we say then? Is there unrighteousness with God? May it never be!</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rom.9.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>For he said to Moses, &ldquo;I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion.&rdquo;\x + Exodus 33:19\x*</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rom.9.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span>So then it is not of him who wills, nor of him who runs, but of God who has mercy.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rom.9.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span>For the Scripture says to Pharaoh, &ldquo;For this very purpose I caused you to be raised up, that I might show in you my power, and that my name might be proclaimed in all the earth.&rdquo;\x + Exodus 9:16\x*</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rom.9.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span>So then, he has mercy on whom he desires, and he hardens whom he desires.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rom.9.19"><span class="verse-num">19&nbsp;</span>You will say then to me, &ldquo;Why does he still find fault? For who withstands his will?&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rom.9.20"><span class="verse-num">20&nbsp;</span>But indeed, O man, who are you to reply against God? Will the thing formed ask him who formed it, &ldquo;Why did you make me like this?&rdquo;\x + Isaiah 29:16; 45:9\x*</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rom.9.21"><span class="verse-num">21&nbsp;</span>Or hasn&rsquo;t the potter a right over the clay, from the same lump to make one part a vessel for honor, and another for dishonor?</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rom.9.22"><span class="verse-num">22&nbsp;</span>What if God, willing to show his wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much patience vessels of wrath made for destruction,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rom.9.23"><span class="verse-num">23&nbsp;</span>and that he might make known the riches of his glory on vessels of mercy, which he prepared beforehand for glory,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rom.9.24"><span class="verse-num">24&nbsp;</span>us, whom he also called, not from the Jews only, but also from the Gentiles?</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rom.9.25"><span class="verse-num">25&nbsp;</span>As he says also in Hosea,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rom.9.26"><span class="verse-num">26&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;It will be that in the place where it was said to them, &lsquo;You are not my people,&rsquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Rom.9.27"><span class="verse-num">27&nbsp;</span>Isaiah cries concerning Israel,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rom.9.28"><span class="verse-num">28&nbsp;</span>for He will finish the work and cut it short in righteousness,</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Rom.9.29"><span class="verse-num">29&nbsp;</span>As Isaiah has said before,</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Rom.9.30"><span class="verse-num">30&nbsp;</span>What shall we say then? That the Gentiles, who didn&rsquo;t follow after righteousness, attained to righteousness, even the righteousness which is of faith;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rom.9.31"><span class="verse-num">31&nbsp;</span>but Israel, following after a law of righteousness, didn&rsquo;t arrive at the law of righteousness.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rom.9.32"><span class="verse-num">32&nbsp;</span>Why? Because they didn&rsquo;t seek it by faith, but as it were by works of the law. They stumbled over the stumbling stone;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rom.9.33"><span class="verse-num">33&nbsp;</span>even as it is written,</span>

<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Ruth.2.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>Naomi had a kinsman of her husband&rsquo;s, a mighty man of wealth, of the family of Elimelech, and his name was Boaz.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Ruth.2.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>Ruth the Moabitess said to Naomi, &ldquo;Let me now go to the field, and glean among the ears of grain after him in whose sight I shall find favor.&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Ruth.2.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>She went, and came and gleaned in the field after the reapers: and she happened to come to the portion of the field belonging to Boaz, who was of the family of Elimelech.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Ruth.2.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>Behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem, and said to the reapers, &ldquo;Yahweh be with you.&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Ruth.2.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>Then Boaz said to his servant who was set over the reapers, &ldquo;Whose young lady is this?&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Ruth.2.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>The servant who was set over the reapers answered, &ldquo;It is the Moabite lady who came back with Naomi out of the country of Moab.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Ruth.2.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>She said, &lsquo;Please let me glean and gather after the reapers among the sheaves.&rsquo; So she came, and has continued even from the morning until now, except that she stayed a little in the house.&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Ruth.2.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>Then Boaz said to Ruth, &ldquo;Listen, my daughter. Don&rsquo;t go to glean in another field, and don&rsquo;t go from here, but stay here close to my maidens.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Ruth.2.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>Let your eyes be on the field that they reap, and go after them. Haven&rsquo;t I commanded the young men not to touch you? When you are thirsty, go to the vessels, and drink from that which the young men have drawn.&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Ruth.2.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>Then she fell on her face, and bowed herself to the ground, and said to him, &ldquo;Why have I found favor in your sight, that you should take knowledge of me, since I am a foreigner?&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Ruth.2.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>Boaz answered her, &ldquo;It has fully been shown me, all that you have done to your mother-in-law since the death of your husband; and how you have left your father and your mother, and the land of your birth, and have come to a people that you didn&rsquo;t know before.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Ruth.2.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>May Yahweh repay your work, and a full reward be given you from Yahweh, the God of Israel, under whose wings you have come to take refuge.&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Ruth.2.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>Then she said, &ldquo;Let me find favor in your sight, my lord, because you have comforted me, and because you have spoken kindly to your handmaid, though I am not as one of your handmaidens.&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Ruth.2.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>At meal time Boaz said to her, &ldquo;Come here, and eat of the bread, and dip your morsel in the vinegar.&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Ruth.2.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>When she had risen up to glean, Boaz commanded his young men, saying, &ldquo;Let her glean even among the sheaves, and don&rsquo;t reproach her.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Ruth.2.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span>Also pull out some for her from the bundles, and leave it, and let her glean, and don&rsquo;t rebuke her.&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Ruth.2.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span>So she gleaned in the field until evening; and she beat out that which she had gleaned, and it was about an ephah<span class="note">+<dfn>1 ephah is about 22 litres or about 2/3 of a bushel</dfn></span> of barley.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Ruth.2.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span>She took it up, and went into the city; and her mother-in-law saw what she had gleaned: and she brought out and gave to her that which she had left after she was sufficed.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Ruth.2.19"><span class="verse-num">19&nbsp;</span>Her mother-in-law said to her, &ldquo;Where have you gleaned today? Where have you worked? Blessed be he who noticed you.&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Ruth.2.20"><span class="verse-num">20&nbsp;</span>Naomi said to her daughter-in-law, &ldquo;Blessed be he of Yahweh, who has not left off his kindness to the living and to the dead.&rdquo; Naomi said to her, &ldquo;The man is a close relative to us, one of our near kinsmen.&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Ruth.2.21"><span class="verse-num">21&nbsp;</span>Ruth the Moabitess said, &ldquo;Yes, he said to me, &lsquo;You shall stay close to my young men, until they have ended all my harvest.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Ruth.2.22"><span class="verse-num">22&nbsp;</span>Naomi said to Ruth her daughter-in-law, &ldquo;It is good, my daughter, that you go out with his maidens, and that they not meet you in any other field.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Ruth.2.23"><span class="verse-num">23&nbsp;</span>So she stayed close to the maidens of Boaz, to glean to the end of barley harvest and of wheat harvest; and she lived with her mother-in-law.</span>

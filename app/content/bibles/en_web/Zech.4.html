<span class="verse" data-osis="Zech.4.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>Then he answered and spoke to me, saying, &ldquo;This is the word of Yahweh to Zerubbabel, saying, &lsquo;Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit,&rsquo; says Yahweh of Armies.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Zech.4.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>Who are you, great mountain? Before Zerubbabel you are a plain; and he will bring out the capstone with shouts of &lsquo;Grace, grace, to it!&rsquo;&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Zech.4.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>Moreover the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,</span>

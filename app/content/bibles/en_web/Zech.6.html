<span class="verse" data-osis="Zech.6.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>Again I lifted up my eyes, and saw, and behold, four chariots came out from between two mountains; and the mountains were mountains of brass.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Zech.6.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>In the first chariot were red horses; in the second chariot black horses;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Zech.6.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>in the third chariot white horses; and in the fourth chariot dappled horses, all of them powerful.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Zech.6.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>Then I asked the angel who talked with me, &ldquo;What are these, my lord?&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Zech.6.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>The angel answered me, &ldquo;These are the four winds of the sky, which go out from standing before the Lord of all the earth.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Zech.6.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>The one with the black horses goes out toward the north country; and the white went out after them; and the dappled went out toward the south country.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Zech.6.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>The strong went out, and sought to go that they might walk back and forth through the earth: and he said, &ldquo;Go around and through the earth!&rdquo; So they walked back and forth through the earth.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Zech.6.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>Then he called to me, and spoke to me, saying, &ldquo;Behold, those who go toward the north country have quieted my spirit in the north country.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Zech.6.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>The word of Yahweh came to me, saying,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Zech.6.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Take of them of the captivity, even of Heldai, of Tobijah, and of Jedaiah; and come the same day, and go into the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah, where they have come from Babylon.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Zech.6.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>Yes, take silver and gold, and make crowns, and set them on the head of Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Zech.6.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>and speak to him, saying, &lsquo;Thus says Yahweh of Armies, &ldquo;Behold, the man whose name is the Branch: and he shall grow up out of his place; and he shall build Yahweh&rsquo;s temple;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Zech.6.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>even he shall build Yahweh&rsquo;s temple; and he shall bear the glory, and shall sit and rule on his throne; and he shall be a priest on his throne; and the counsel of peace shall be between them both.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Zech.6.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>The crowns shall be to Helem, and to Tobijah, and to Jedaiah, and to Hen the son of Zephaniah, for a memorial in Yahweh&rsquo;s temple.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Zech.6.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>Those who are far off shall come and build in Yahweh&rsquo;s temple; and you shall know that Yahweh of Armies has sent me to you.
